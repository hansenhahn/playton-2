Here's a classic puzzle. The rules are
simple. You can move any ball on the
board below as long as it satisfies the
following conditions:
<->To move, jump your selected ball over an
adjacent space occupied by another ball
into an empty space on the other side.
You can't jump diagonally.
<->Once you've made the jump, the ball you
jumped over disappears from the board.
<->To complete the puzzle, you must remove all
balls from the board except for one.

OK, enough rules. Try it for yourself!
!******************************!
Well done!

This is one configuration of a puzzle known
as peg solitaire. As the name suggests, the
traditional version of this game is played
with pegs that you insert into holes in the
game board.
!******************************!
Too bad!
!******************************!
To make the first of the balls disappear,
jump the ball in the centre of the
cross over the ball to its immediate left
or right.
!******************************!
Move the ball at the very bottom into
the space formerly occupied by the
centre ball.

With just a few balls to go now, you
should be able to sail through the rest
of this puzzle.
!******************************!
With puzzles of this type, your first
move will often determine whether or
not you'll be able to solve the puzzle.

You got it!

Peg solitaire is a puzzle with a long history.
It's thought to have first come into
popularity around the 17th century.
!******************************!
Too bad!
!******************************!
Your options for a first jump are fairly
limited. It has to be one of the four
balls surrounding the centre ball. The
tough part is deciding what to do next.

For your second move, pop a ball into
the space that opened up when you
moved the first one.
!******************************!
Next, move a ball into the open centre
space.
!******************************!
Read carefully, because this next move
is key.

You need to take the ball now sitting 
in the centre space and move it in the
direction that you moved your ball in
the first move.

The rest of the puzzle is up to you.

This game is often played on two different
types of boards: English and French. The
puzzle you just played used an
English-style board.
!******************************!
Too bad!
!******************************!
Wow, these puzzles are really getting
tough. Here's a hint to take the edge
off this puzzle.

Start by clearing the ball that's third
from the edge, sitting in the bottom row.
!******************************!
Next, move the ball on the edge of
the bottom row to fill the space that
opened up when you removed the ball
in your first move. Then, repeat the
process detailed in Hints 1 and 2
on the other side of the triangle and
move the balls around until you're left
with a number of balls arranged in a
shape that resembles a pine tree.
The rest of this puzzle is up to you.
!******************************!
Hey, didn't Hint 2 clearly say, <''>the rest
is up to you<''>? Well, just know that you
won't be able to rely on too many hints
in the <''>Disappearing Act<''> puzzles to
come! You can have a hint this time,
though.

Select a ball one in from the outer
edge of the pine tree and jump it
upwards. Then, from this new location,
jump over the tip of the tree. OK, this
time, the rest really is up to you.

Nice!

The only condition for solving these puzzles
was eliminating all but one ball from the
board, but the true solution to these
puzzles requires you to finish with the ball
positioned in the centre space.

Perhaps that will provide some incentive
for you to revisit a few of these peg
solitaire puzzles.


!******************************!
Too bad!
!******************************!
These puzzles are a lot more fun if you
experiment and try to come to the
answer on your own. Don't depend on
Hints 2 and 3 to give away too much
of the puzzle.

Start this puzzle by moving the ball
in the centre of the second row from
the top.

No more hints to be had here! Instead,
here's a little fun fact. Did you know
that peg solitaire is actually known as
brainvita in India?

Oh, and just so you know, Hint 3 is
also trivia.
!******************************!
There are many games known as solitaire,
some using boards divided into spaces
and some using playing cards.
On a related note, a very large number
of computer games you could call
solitaire games have been made since
the early days of video games.

Get ready, because this one's going to be
rough. Just like before, you can move
any ball on the board below as long as it
satisfies the following conditions:

adjacent space occupied by another ball
into an empty space on the other side.
You can't jump diagonally.

Nicely done!

One variation of this puzzle challenges the
player to complete the puzzle in the fewest
number of moves possible.

For the purposes of this puzzle, multiple
consecutive jumps using a single ball count
as only one move. If you've got some time on
your hands, why not try this puzzle again
and see how few moves you need to
complete it?
!******************************!
Too bad!
!******************************!
Surely it's more fun to think this one
through on your own...

...OK, fine, you can have a hint, but
just one. Do not start off this puzzle
by moving a ball into the centre space.
Instead, your first goal should be to
move things so you get rid of one of
those four balls at the very edge of
the shape. But where to start?
!******************************!
OK, OK, you can have another hint.

Start by moving one of the balls three
spaces in on the third row up. Move this
ball down to clear one ball and then
across to remove the ball at the bottom
of the shape. Then move a ball in the
third row up in the same direction as
your last move. Next, move the ball you
used from move one into the spot that
just opened up.
!******************************!
If you follow Hint 2 and continue
playing a little yourself, you should
be able to arrange the remaining balls
into a shape that's almost the same as
the pine tree you saw in <''>Disappearing
Act 3<''>. Use what you've learned to finish
the rest of this puzzle.

Chess knights move two squares forwards
and one square perpendicular on each
turn. The initial direction can be up,
down, left or right.

Move this knight around the entire board,
landing on each square only once.

!******************************!
For your second and third moves, you
don't have any choice where to put
the knight.

But after that, you should move the

Shogi, often known as Japanese chess,
has a piece similar to the knight
in Western chess.

However, unlike knights in Western chess,
shogi knights can only advance down

more flexible than their Japanese
counterparts.

If you're really stuck, take a break
by setting a smaller goal. You could try
getting stuck in the fewest number of
moves possible, or move the knight so
that it traces the shape of a letter.
Better yet, combine these little games.
For example, draw two Ys horizontally,
then try to get your knight stuck in
as few turns as possible.

<0109>Walking the Dog
<00><32><2D><28><11><40><16><6C><F6><03><04><1B>
A young girl takes her dog out for a walk
with her dad. The girl starts walking with
the dog on a leash 10 seconds before the
dad starts. The second the dad steps out,
the girl takes the dog off the leash and
the dog runs over to the dad. Upon reaching
him, the dog turns around and heads for the
girl. The dog keeps doing this until the dad
catches up with the girl. If the dog moves
at five metres per second, the father at
two metres per second and the daughter at
one metre per second, how far does the dog
run by the time the dad catches up to his
daughter?
!******************************!
Perfect!

The dog will have run 50 metres in total.

The dog runs for the entire time it takes
for the father to catch up with his
daughter. Since the daughter has a 10
metre head start and her dad gains on her
at a rate of one metre per second, he'll
catch up in 10 seconds. The dog is running
at a rate of five metres per second, so
the answer must be 50 metres.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Are you sure you aren't overthinking this
one?
!******************************!
Puzzles with long explanations often
have traps hidden in their phrasing.
Try not to get caught out.

The dad moves at two metres per second
and the daughter moves at one metre
per second, so for every second that
passes, the distance between the two
shrinks by one metre.
!******************************!
The father sets out 10 seconds after
his daughter. The daughter walks at a
rate of one metre per second, so she's
already 10 metres ahead of her father
when he starts walking.

Using what you know from this hint and
the last one, you should be able to
work out that the father catches up to
his daughter in 10 seconds.

The dog runs at a rate of five metres
per second.

The father catches up to his daughter
in exactly 10 seconds.

Be sure to consider everything the
inspector has to say about where he walked.

The inspector says he took one turn at
a junction with a cafe, but that doesn't
mean he had to turn in the direction of
the cafe he saw. Instead, what he's

only able to turn once at any junction

<0111>How Many Turns?
<00><32><2D><28><11><25><03><6E><E9><03><04><3F>
Chelmey sent his squad out to investigate
an incident. Before leaving, he said this:
<''>I want you to search the entire area shown
on this map. Take any route you want, but
report how many times you turned in the
process. You're free to turn left or right,
but U-turns are strictly forbidden!<''>

The bobbies completed their shift and
returned to report their turns. Judging by
their reports, though, it seems at least
one man was loafing on the job. Touch the
numbers you think are suspicious to mark
them with an X.
!******************************!
Sharp thinking!

The two men who took 105 and 113 turns
must have been slacking off. Since the men
started out on a horizontal path, you can
infer that if they turned an odd number of
times, they'd end up on a vertical path.
Conversely, if they made an even number of
turns, they'd end up on a horizontal road.

Any bobby who did his job properly would
have to turn an even number of times to
get back to the station, which is at the
end of a horizontal road.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think hard about the puzzle and try again.
!******************************!
If one of the policemen had said he
turned a total of 1,000 times during the
course of his investigation, the
inspector would have no reason to doubt
the bobby was telling the truth.
!******************************!
With U-turns forbidden, there's a
certain logic you should be able to
find in all this confusion.
!******************************!
Leaving the station and turning an
odd number of times, regardless of
the number, will land you on a vertical
street. Conversely, turn an even number
of times after leaving the station and
you'll end up on a road that runs
horizontally across the screen.

Now look at the board in the centre. This
light has three contact points: A, B and C.
No matter whether you hold contact points
A and B, B and C or A and C together, the
light stays on. In that case, how must the
wires be connected on the underside of the
board? Draw the solution that requires the
fewest number of connections. The dotted
red line indicates a known wire.
!******************************!
Bright idea!

All you really have to do is connect
that light bulb to the battery.
The puzzle tells you that the light
stays lit no matter which combination
of contact points are held together.
Naturally, the light will also stay lit
when none of those connections are made.

Are you sure your solution meets all the
conditions set out by the puzzle?
!******************************!
<''>No matter whether you hold contact
points A and B, B and C or A and C

This might make you think that the
electricity has to run through all three

time, the positive and negative signals
need to be isolated from each other,
which makes things more difficult.

again as carefully as you can.

You've stacked three dice in a column.
At the points where two dice touch, the
faces that are touching add up to five.

If one visible face of the bottom die is
showing a one, what number must be on the
top face of the top die?

Each die is identical and all sets of opposing
faces on each die add up to seven, just like
any other die.
!******************************!
That's right!

Since you know that the sum of each set of
opposing faces is seven, you can easily
narrow down the possibilities. With a
little smart thinking, as detailed above,
you'll soon arrive at the answer: six.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think hard about the puzzle and try again.
!******************************!
At the two points where two dice touch,
the sum of the two faces making contact
equals five. If that's so, then each of
these four faces must be a number
between one and four.
!******************************!
The options for the top face of the
bottom die are limited. That face can
only be a two, three or four.
!******************************!
Assume for a minute that the top face
of the bottom die is a four. If so,
then the bottom face of the middle die
must be a one, which would make the top
face of this second die a six. Since
you know that the four faces in contact
with each other must be between one and
four, you can rule out this possibility.

Three houses face a single common field.
The heads of these three houses, A, B and
C, decide to work together to seed the
field. Unfortunately, C injures himself
just before work starts, so A and B do all
the work together. To seed the entire field,
A works five days and B works four.

Feeling guilty, C decides to pay A and B
for doing his part of the job. To thank
them, C pays them a total of nine coins,
divided up according to how much work each
person did. Can you work out how many
coins A and B each received?
!******************************!
Smart!

A received six coins and B got three.
You might have been tempted to answer 
five and four coins respectively but,
as shown above, that isn't quite correct.
A and B both had to work three days to
finish their own shares of the work.
Since C wanted to pay A and B for the
work they did for him, he had to base
his payment on the two days of extra work
A did and the one day of work B did.
Therefore, A should receive twice the
pay B did.
!******************************!
Too bad!

When you think about it, the pay you
suggested isn't quite fair.
!******************************!
It's tempting to think that the answer
is to pay each man a coin for each day
he worked, resulting in a total of five
coins for A and four coins for B. But
then that wouldn't be much of a puzzle,
would it?

Remember, the original agreement was
that each man would do an equal share of
the work.
!******************************!
Simply put, A and B are getting paid for
doing the work C was supposed to do.

When considering your answer, don't
factor in the days A and B were
supposed to work according to the
original agreement. C wouldn't be
paying them out of his own pocket for
work they were supposed to do in the
first place.
!******************************!
The coins should be distributed based
on the number of days each person
worked to cover the three days C was
supposed to work.

A did two days, B did one.

<0117>Three Couples
<00><1E><14><0A><11><40><02><75><E8><03><04><FF>
A yellowed photograph shows three couples.
In the photo, no one man is standing
directly above his spouse. Of the three
women present, two are sisters and are
sitting next to each other. The elder
sister's husband is the man without a
moustache. Everyone in the picture is
wearing a hat, except the husband of the
younger sister. The woman unrelated to the
other two is sitting in front of the younger
sister's husband.
So, can you find the man in this lot who
is married to neither sister?
Choose from A, B or C.
!******************************!
Great job!

The answer is B. Finding the answer to this
one just requires close reading.

You know the elder sister's husband has
no moustache, so he must be A. You also
know that the younger sister's husband has
no hat, so he's obviously C. With those two
choices eliminated, the answer is clear.

Oh, and in case you're wondering, the
elder sister is E, the little sister is D
and the last woman, F, is married to B.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Make sure you read the clues correctly!
!******************************!
There's no need to decipher the
relationships of every person in the
picture. Just focus on finding the
answer to the question at hand.
!******************************!
Who's married to the eldest sister?
Using the clues you've been given,
you should be able to find the answer
to that question almost immediately.
!******************************!
While we're on the subject, finding the
husband of the younger sister should be
a breeze as well.

With those two men identified, this
puzzle is as good as solved.

Ah, nice and tidy!

Do your part to keep your town clean!
!******************************!
Too bad!
!******************************!
Feeling like you just can't clear a path,
no matter what you do?

First, take one of the two L-shaped
blocks closest to the bottom and move
things around until you can slip that
block into one of the gaps to the far
left and far right at the top. Choose
the gap that lets you fit the wider
side of your L-shaped block flush
against the wall. 
!******************************!
Continuing from where Hint 1 left off,
your next goal is to move blocks around
so that the blue block in the bin swaps
places with the remaining L-shaped block
in the bottom row.

Make sure you drag the L-shaped block
in question all the way down into the 
bin.
!******************************!
Next, take the L-shaped block you
tucked away in the corner in Hint 1
and bring it back down to its original
position. Now take the two L-shaped
blocks that sat on top at the beginning
of the puzzle and tuck them away in the
gaps located in the top left and right.
Once these two blocks are out of the
way, you can finally drag that hunk of
rubbish out of its hole at the top of
the screen. Now all you've got to do is
get it in the bin!

<0119>The Fake Coins
<00><1E><1B><18><11><3B><16><77><F6><03><04><FF>
There are 10 coins in each of the five bags
below. One of these bags is filled with fake
coins that are lighter than the real ones.
A real coin weighs 10 grams, but a fake coin
is one gram lighter. If you're using a scale
that can register up to 200 grams, what is
the fewest number of times you could use
the scale to find the one bag filled with
fake coins?
!******************************!
You got it!

You only need to use the scale once.
From every bag, remove the number of coins
indicated by the bag's number. Then you
just weigh these 15 coins once.

If all of the coins were real, their combined
weight would be 150 grams, but you'll end up
with a weight less than this. The difference
between this actual weight and 150 grams
corresponds to the number on the bag of
fake coins.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Stick with it until you work it out!
!******************************!
The bag of fake coins contains only fake
coins, each of them one gram lighter
than a real coin. So, you could take one
coin out of each bag and weigh them each
in turn, using the scale five times. 

But that wouldn't make for a very
interesting puzzle, would it?
!******************************!
Think about how to accomplish your goal
in fewer than five weighings. If you
tried to weigh all the bags at once,
you would go over the scale's measuring
capacity.
!******************************!
Hint 2 had the idea of weighing all the
bags at once. There are 10 10-gram
coins in each of the five bags, for a
total of 500 grams. But one bag contains
fake coins, so the weight is actually
less than that.

Perhaps the key to solving this really
is to weigh all the bags at once, in a
sense?

How many stones should you remove to give
yourself the best chance of getting the
most money possible?
!******************************!
Well done!

If you remove 100 stones from the vase,
only one will remain inside. If that
remaining stone is white, it means you've
sucessfully removed 50 stones of each
colour. Of course, removing just two
stones would give you the same chance of
winning the coins as removing 100 stones,
but the amount of money you receive for
sucessfully removing 100 stones dwarfs the
reward you'd receive for two stones.

Circle the spot where the treasure is hidden.
!******************************!
You did it!

The treasure is buried in roughly the
centre of the map.

The sum you needed to work with was 10.
You could organise the numbers so that
each line added up to a total of nine, but
that is not the highest possible sum.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Are you certain each line of numbers adds
up to the same total?

Oh, and what about the sum of each line?
Is it the largest number possible given the
conditions?
!******************************!
The number 4 is already in place, so your
task is to decide where the numbers 1,
2, 3, 5 and 6 go.

Remember, your goal is to make every set
of numbers in a straight line add up to
the same total. Pay special attention to
the two lines that use the number 4, as
they are crucial to solving the puzzle.
 
!******************************!
Focus your attention on the spot on the
far right and how it forms a line with
the number 4.

Were you to insert a smaller number like
1 or 2 here, your total for the whole
line couldn't be any larger than 6.
With a total like that, there'd be no
place for you to put the number 6,
making the puzzle unsolvable. So, what
should go in that far right spot?

The box shown below is fitted with a lock
consisting of two dials. You can't turn the
blue dial directly, but when you turn the red
dial, the blue dial moves an equal amount.
In order to see the relationship between
the two dials, you try turning the red one
from its original position, as shown below.
In order to open the lock, you must turn
the blue dial to 3, 6, 4 and 1 in that order.
Since you can't turn the blue dial directly,
to which numbers must you turn the red dial
in order to produce the desired numbers on
the blue dial?
!******************************!
That was tough!

The red dial needs to be turned to 2, 7,
1 and 4 to produce the numbers you need on
the blue dial.

It turns out these two dials actually rotate
in opposite directions. One way to solve
this problem is to create a chart with each
dial's corresponding numbers, like the one
shown above.
!******************************!
Too bad!

If you can just work out how the two dials
turn in relation to one another, the rest is
a breeze.
!******************************!
When the red dial reads 0, the blue dial 
reads 5. When the red dial reads 3, the
blue dial reads 2.

As stated in the puzzle, the distance
the blue dial moves is equal to the
distance the red dial moves. When the
red dial moves from 0 to 3, the blue dial
moves from 5 to 2. Read that last
sentence again and think about what it
says about the relationship between the
dials.
!******************************!
Did you catch on to what Hint 1 was
trying to tell you? The red and blue
dials turn the exact same amount but,
as you may have noticed, the numbers on
the dials move in opposite directions.
!******************************!
When you turn the red dial, the blue
dial moves the same amount in the
opposite direction.

All you need to do is construct a quick

red dial correspond to other numbers on
the blue dial. Why not try using the

A careful read of the puzzle reveals that
when the boy was the girl's current age,
her age was half of the boy's current age.
The boy's current age is 20, and half of

ascertain that the girl was 10 back when

empty, one is actually filled with water.
See if you can find it.

When deducing your answer, ignore the
weight of each string and stick. 
!******************************!
Nicely done!

The answer is A. The biggest stick connects
to the branch at a point left of the centre
of the stick. Four cans hang from each side
of this big stick, but because the string
holding it to the tree is left of centre,
the set of four cans on the left must be
heavier than the ones on the right.
A, B, C and D all hang from the left side
of the big stick. However, judging by the
number of cans and the positions of the
strings, it's easy to see that A is the
heaviest.
!******************************!
Too bad!

!******************************!
Study each can one at a time and
observe how they're balanced, relative
to each other.

Notice how the biggest stick is level
even though it's connected to the tree
at a point left of the stick's centre.

This shows that the water must be in
one of the four cans hanging from the
left side of the big stick.
!******************************!
We know that the water is in one of
the four cans on the left, so finding
the can in question should be a breeze.

in moderation, but the smell can be pretty
potent. Someone put garlic cloves in this
intricate container and they're really
stinking up the room. Use the two corks
below to help our friend deal with the
smell.

Touch the screen in the place you want to
put the corks. Your answer must use no
more than two corks.
!******************************!
Ah, sweet relief!

Each of the three holes in the container is
connected to the garlic, so there's no real
way to seal off the container using two
corks. With no way to contain the smell, our
friend had no choice but to plug up his
nostrils.

Hopefully he had the good sense to stay
inside where no one could see him like that!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Those corks aren't doing the trick in their
current locations.
!******************************!
The most logical thing to do at first is
to use the Memo Function to trace which
openings in the container lead to the
garlic cloves.
!******************************!
Hmm? Something seems strange, you say?

Why yes, the fact that all three
openings in the container connect to
the garlic is a bit strange...

How to contain the smell then?
!******************************!
Since you're only allowed to use
two corks, you can't block all three
openings in the container.

You'll just have to look for another
set of openings that can be sealed
off using only two corks.

<0075>Sweets for Five
<00><19><16><13><12><38><09><4A><EF><03><04><28>
You have a box of four different kinds of
sweets arranged in no particular order.
Your job is to divide these treats into
five equal portions. To do so, you need
to make sure each portion contains the
exact same number and variety of sweets.

Got it? Good, then get started!
!******************************!
Sweet!

The puzzle's solution is shown above.

Now remember, those sweets are for
everyone, so don't forget to share!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Give the puzzle another try.
!******************************!
First, count out how many sweets you
have. There are four types of sweet.
You only have five of the first three
types, but 10 of the fourth type.
You therefore have to put two of this
fourth type of sweet into each of the
five portions.
!******************************!
Look for sweets that are one per
portion, in other words, sweets of
which there are only five in total.
If you find two of these sweets next to
each other, you can draw a line between
them, since they can't be in the same
portion.

Start by drawing in these lines.
!******************************!
Do you see the three of the same kind
of sweet in the third row? The leftmost
two sweets there are part of a single
portion. The third of those three
sweets and the identical sweet directly
below it are part of a different portion.

Now that you know that much, you
shouldn't have too much trouble
finishing the puzzle.

<0076>Top of the Tower
<00><14><12><10><12><3C><05><4B><EB><03><04><FF>
In one quiet town there's a tower that
commands a view of the whole town.

Since you can see every building in town
from the tower, logic dictates that you
should be able to see the top of the tower
from any building in town. As you can see
on the map shown below, however, there's
one building in town from which you clearly
have no chance of seeing the top of the
tower, no matter which window you look out
of.

Can you find this building?
!******************************!
Good thinking!

From inside the tower, there's no way to
see the top of it. You may be able to stick
your neck out of a window and look up, but
you still won't be able to see the top of it.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Don't forget, you're looking for a building
where the view of the top of the tower is
blocked.
!******************************!
Looking for some buildings that block
each other's view?

Hmm, it doesn't look like there are any
buildings like that around town.
!******************************!
You need to find a building from which
the top of the tower can't be seen.

To put it another way, you're looking
for a buiding that doesn't allow you to
see the outside of the tower.
!******************************!
There's one building from which you
definitely won't be able to see
the outside of the tower.

<0077>Balancing Ornaments
<00><1E><14><0A><11><46><1A><4C><00><04><04><46>
Small ornaments dangle from a metal bar, and
they've thrown the bar off balance.

The five ornament strings are spaced
equally apart and each type of ornament
weighs a different amount. Three light
ornaments weigh the same as one heavy
ornament, while two light ornaments weigh
the same as a medium ornament.

Place one of the three ornaments in the
rectangle into the space marked <''>?<''> to
restore the bar's balance.
!******************************!
Good job!

The crescent moon ornament is just heavy
enough to balance things out. A single
star ornament weighs the same as one sun
and one moon together. The strand of
ornaments that is supposed to
counterbalance the one with a <''>?<''> doesn't
have any star-shaped ornaments, but if you
compare the ornaments as shown above you
can work out what should go in the <''>?<''>
space regardless.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Concentrate on working out which of the
three ornaments must be the heaviest.
!******************************!
The middle strand of ornaments doesn't
affect the balance of the bar, so ignore
it.

Also, the two strands hanging at the
ends of the bar are the same weight, so
try comparing the ornaments on the far
left to the ornaments on the far right.
You might find out something new.
!******************************!
Look at the strands on the far left and
the far right. While they both contain
sun and moon ornaments, only the far
right strand has a star.
By comparing the ornaments on these
two strands, you can probably work
out how many suns and moons it takes
to equal the weight of a star.
!******************************!
A single star weighs the same as one
sun and one moon.

Now that you know the weight of one
star, you should now be able to compare
the two strands next to the middle
strand.

<0078>A Maze of Doors
<00><19><14><0F><12><47><05><4D><EB><03><04><45>
All the doors in the maze below only open
when pushed from one direction, as shown.

It is therefore impossible to pass through
every room while going through the maze
from the entrance to the exit. However,
this feat would be possible if one of the
doors could open in the opposite direction.
Can you find and circle this door?
!******************************!
You did it!

You have to pass through every room on the
way to the exit to solve the puzzle, but no
one ever said you can't pass through the
same room twice.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Use the Memo Function to draw your
proposed route while you think about the
problem.
!******************************!
Let's review this puzzle's conditions.
You need to make one door open in the
opposite direction and you must pass
through every room on your way to the
exit.

But no one ever said you could only pass
through each room once.

!******************************!
Starting from the entrance, you'll soon
bump into a door that should open the
opposite way. So, to proceed, one of the
first doors you meet will have to open
in the opposite direction.

The upper door in the first room and
the two doors in the room to the
immediate right of the first room open in
a direction that keeps you from passing
through. One of these three doors is
the door you'll need to change.

The upper door in the first room is
fine the way it is.

<0079>The Gear Switch
<00><14><0A><05><11><46><02><4E><E8><03><04><FF>
The button that opens the door in front of
you is buried deep within this machine, so
you can't push it directly. However, by
pulling the lever at the top to the left or
right, you can move the various gears and
plates in the machine, allowing you to press
the button at the bottom.

In order to push the green button, should
you pull the lever towards A or B?
!******************************!
Nicely done!

Moving the lever towards B will spin the
gears in a way that causes the bottom lever
to hit the green button.

Since there are only two possible answers
for this puzzle, you could have just
guessed, but hopefully you were able to
work it out properly!
!******************************!
Too bad!

There are only two ways to answer this
question, so the answer must be the option
you didn't pick.

Before you answer, though, think the puzzle
through so you can understand the solution.
!******************************!
When one gear rotates with another, the
two gears must rotate in opposite
directions.

Use the Memo Function to keep track of
the direction of each gear's rotation.
!******************************!
The gear at the very bottom has to
rotate clockwise to hit the switch,
so the board of teeth directly above it
will need to move to the right.
Make sense? Now continue that line of
thought as you move up towards the
lever.
!******************************!
The board of teeth underneath the
three gears at the top needs to move to
the left. Therefore, the gear directly
above it needs to rotate clockwise.

Keep going until you reach the lever at
the top!

<0080>The Puzzling Lift

The circuit board for the lift contains a
puzzle. According to the instructions, you
need to make the blue and red balls switch
places in order to restore power to the
lift. Are you up to the task?
!******************************!
Good job!

So, how many moves did it take you to
complete the task? If you did it in 12
moves, give yourself a pat on the back!

Oh... Listen! Do you hear that? It sounds
like the lift is up and running again.
!******************************!
Too bad!
!******************************!
There are several ways you could go
about solving this puzzle. One sure-fire
technique is to work with those
L-shaped blocks. You can free up some
extra room by moving these blocks so
that they fit together neatly with
neighbouring blocks.

!******************************!
In order to get both of those balls to
swap places, you first need to move one
ball out of its hole and park it
somewhere while you move the other one.
To do so, clear out some space by
gathering all those L-shaped blocks
on either the left or right side of
the box.
!******************************!
If the method from Hint 2 isn't working
for you, here's another technique you
can try. Create space by slotting
L-shaped blocks together to create
rectangles. In order to do this your goal
should be to move the L-shaped blocks
to the opposite edges of the box before
combining them.

Find the four-digit code that opens the
safe. You can use the digits 0 to 5 in your
answer, but each digit can only be used
once. The small lights next to each row of
digits are the key to finding the code, as
they tell you how much in common that row
has with the code. A white light indicates a
digit that is in the code but in a different
place in the sequence. An orange light
indicates a digit that is in the code and in
the correct spot. Touch the digits at the
bottom of the screen to change them, then
touch #rSubmit#x when you have your answer.
!******************************!
That's right!

The code is 0154. You could solve this by
entering numbers haphazardly until you
stumble upon the solution, but it's much
more fun to think your way to the answer.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Give the puzzle another try.
!******************************!
Start by working out which digits belong
in the code, regardless of order.
!******************************!
You may have already noticed, but every
digit in the code is in the very top row
of digits. Two of the digits in 4150 are
even in the right place.
!******************************!
Take a look at the third row of digits.

You can see that two digits match ones
in the code and are in the correct
position. Since you know the code uses
4, 1, 5 and 0, you can assume the 0
and 1 from this row are part of the
code and in the right place.

Now work out where 4 and 5 go.

The wires connecting the lift to the button

However, if you can connect the
negative (-) and positive (+) wires on the
top to the wires carrying the same charge
below, you can fix the lift. To do this,
draw lines between sets of terminals.
Draw two lines to connect each positive and
negative terminal to its counterpart and
get the lift running again.
!******************************!
We're back in business!

The lift is working again!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Did you make sure to connect the positive
wire (+) and negative wire (-) to wires
with the same charge?
!******************************!
You need to connect wires with the same
symbol together. So + goes with + and
- with another -.

If you examine the tangle of wires,
finding the solution should be simple
enough.
!******************************!
To make things simpler, identify the
wires that are connected to some other
area off the screen and eliminate them
as possible answers.

In the top row of wires, the rightmost
wire and the one third from the right
run off the screen.

You can use the middle plate and move

See if you can come up with a rule for
effectively moving pancakes around. 
 
!******************************!
Developing an effective way of moving
the smallest pancake is key because
you can't place anything on top of it.

pancake on the red plate.
Next, move the smallest pancake on top
of the pancake on the right, and bring
a new pancake over to fill the middle
plate. After that, take the smallest
pancake and move it to the left plate.

Looks like you went and spent that hint

There's a card on the table that belongs

the club is in and the diagonal line the
diamond is in. Therefore, you can safely
conclude that this card must be a spade.

What card do you suppose belongs in the
bottom-left corner? This column already
has a diamond and heart in it and
there's a spade to the immediate right

must be a club.

Knowing this, you can also fill in the
last card in the leftmost column, which

The red section has an area of 400 square

the flower beds and fit the pieces to the
circle as shown on the diagram on the right,
you can turn the circle into a square.
Once you do, the sides of the square will
have the same length as the diameter of a

<00><14><12><10><11><34><05><59><EB><03><04><FF>
The fountain shown below has the unusual
ability to indicate the age of those who
approach it.

For example, if a five-year-old child were
to approach, the fountain would fire off
water from spouts A, B, C, D and E in that
order. For age 15, the middle spout would
fire, followed by spouts A to E. For
someone aged 30, the middle spout would
fire off three times. Given the fountain's
method of indicating age, there's one
utterly useless spout on the fountain.
Find and circle this spout.
!******************************!
Good catch!

The spout marked J is basically useless.
A to I represent a unit of one year each,
displaying numbers from 1-9, and the middle
spout represents a unit of 10 years, spout
J will never be used. 
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think about the fountain's method of
indicating age.
!******************************!
The puzzle asks for you to find a spout
that's utterly useless, meaning the 
spout never gets used. Which one could
that be?
!******************************!
Read over the conditions that cause
each spout to spray water, then try
applying that knowledge. For example,
think about how the fountain would
indicate the ages from 10 to 20.
!******************************!
Spout A fires off to indicate one year,
A and B fire for two, A, B and C for
three, A, B, C and D for four and so on.

after another are meant to indicate
nine, then...

of land.<''>

Draw lines using the stylus to separate
each son's plot of land.

!******************************!
Good job!

Now that everyone has their own land,
hopefully they can all get along.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Give the puzzle another try.
!******************************!
There are 16 squares to be divided
between four people, so every person
should receive a parcel of land
consisting of four squares.  
!******************************!
Draw a line right down the middle of
the map from top to bottom.
!******************************!
Next, lay down some boundaries so that
no two houses are positioned on the
same parcel of land.

<0092>Precious Metals
<00><28><24><20><11><25><17><5B><FD><03><04><FF>
Lucky you! You've inherited a five-square
plot of land that's rich in precious metals.
Each chunk of copper ore has a value of
one, each silver chunk has a value of three
and each gold chunk has a whopping value of
five. You're allowed to pick five squares
of land for yourself, but the five squares
must be connected to each other. Squares
diagonal to one another don't count as
connected.

Your task is to claim the most valuable
five-square plot possible. Can you do it?
!******************************!
You're rich!

The plot of land displayed is the only one
that acheives a value of 10, the highest
value possible given the conditions of the
puzzle.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Nope, that's not it.
!******************************!
Gold ore is worth a whopping five times
more than copper, so focus on claiming
some of that.

Wouldn't it be great if you could find
a five-square plot of land with two
pieces of gold ore on it? Sadly, that
doesn't seem likely.
!******************************!
Unfortunately, no single five-square
plot of land contains two pieces of
gold ore.

Now, it should be easy to find a plot
that has two pieces of silver ore on
it, but remember, your first priority
is choosing the plot with the highest
total value.
!******************************!
Copper is worth one, silver is worth
three and gold is worth five. Given
these values, you should be able to find
a single plot of land worth 10. Find
this plot and you've found your answer.

<0093>How Old Am I?
<00><1E><1B><18><11><27><16><5C><F6><03><04><FF>
<''>The difference between Mum's age and
Dad's age is the same as my age. Oh, and my
big sister's twice my age, which happens to
be one third my mum's age. And one more
thing: In five years, I'll be my sister's age.

How old am I?<''>
!******************************!
Hey, not bad!

The girl's father is 35 and her mother is
30, meaning the difference in their ages
is the same as the girl's age, as she said.

As for her big sister, she's 10. That's twice
the girl's age and a third of their mother's.
In five years, the girl will be 10, which is
her sister's age now.

Kids these days grow up so quickly!
!******************************!
Nope!

A grown-up like you should be able to
work this one out!
!******************************!
When you've got a puzzle like this one,
what you should do is go over all the
information you've got and find the
stuff you can use. The difference
between her parents' ages probably
won't help you. But her sister's age
might be more useful...
!******************************!
The girl's sister is twice her age, and
in five years' time, the girl will be
the age her sister is now.
!******************************!
Read Hint 2 really carefully...

Five years ago, her sister was the
same age she is now, and her sister
is now twice her age.

<0094>Puzzling Cubes
<00><28><1E><14><11><36><10><5D><F6><03><04><FF>
Eight cubes have been created based on the
flat plan shown below. These have been
combined to build a larger cube. One of the
eight small cubes has had the letters on
each of its faces erased. The big cube has
been constructed in such a way that all of
the smaller cubes' faces that aren't visible
are pressed against the same-lettered face
of another cube.

Knowing this, can you work out what letter
belongs on the face the arrow is pointing
to? Your answer will be one letter, from
A to F.
!******************************!
That's right!

The correct letter is B.

Whew. That was a tough puzzle, wasn't it?
!******************************!
Too bad!

Don't just take a guess and run with it!
You need to logically work your way towards
the answer. It's that kind of puzzle.

!******************************!
The answer to this puzzle won't simply
pop into your head when you make some
key realisation. You need to work your
way to it.

Three different cubes are touching
three different faces of the cube in
question. Find the letters that must
be on those faces of the unmarked cube.

!******************************!
If the unmarked cube had its faces
restored, all four letters on the right
side of the big cube would be Cs. Note
how all four Cs don't point the same way.
!******************************!
Did you work out which letters are
on the hidden faces of the unmarked
cube?
They are A, D and E.

<0095>Box of Books
<00><1E><1B><18><11><37><16><5E><F6><03><04><FF>
The box shown below has a height, width and
depth of 30cm. You'd like to place as many
books as possible in the box. Each book is
20cm wide by 20cm long by 10cm thick. How
many books can you pack into this box?

Books can only be placed in the box when
they are closed, but you can position each
book however you like inside the box.
!******************************!
Very nice!

If you arrange the books in the box in the
method shown, you can cram a whopping six
books into it!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think in three dimensions to find the
solution. 
!******************************!
If all you had to do to solve this puzzle
was count how many books you can stack
in the box before it fills up, it wouldn't
be much fun.

You'll need to think creatively and in
three dimensions to solve this one.
!******************************!
The bottom of the box measures 30cm
by 30 cm. Each book is 20 cm by 20 cm,
so there is only space for one book
at the bottom of the box.
But if you do that, you'll be left with
10 cm spare on both sides. Say, isn't
that the exact same size as the
thickness of one book? 
!******************************!
Even if you place three books upright
in the box and use two more to fill what
gaps you can, you'll still have a good
chunk of wasted space on your hands.
Fitting the books together in a
space-efficient way is of utmost
importance in solving this puzzle.

<0096>A Ghostly Puzzle
<00><1E><1B><18><11><2B><02><5F><E8><03><04><2F>
Yikes! There's a ghost in the forest!

...Or so you thought, until you realised that
the spectre hovering in front of you was
just a figure cut out of wood hanging from
a branch. Looking around the area, you
notice four pieces of wood scattered in the
grass. From which one of these wooden
planks was the ghost cut out?

You have four choices: A, B, C or D.
Beware! The correct board may have flipped
over in the grass.

!******************************!
Good eye!

The ghost was cut from board B. The board
must have flipped over as it fell to the
ground. All the other boards have slight
differences that set them apart from the
correct one.
!******************************!
Too bad!

All the boards might look the same at first,
but if you look carefully, you'll start to
see the differences.

Don't forget to consider the outline each
board makes when flipped over, too.
!******************************!
Think you've found the answer? You're
sure? Well, just to be safe, compare its
outline to the ghost one more time. Don't
forget to look at little details, like the
shape of its hands.
!******************************!
You should pay extra attention to the
length of the ghost's tail.
!******************************!
Take note of which way the ghost's
arms should be facing!

Oh, and just so you know, the board
you're looking for needs to be flipped
over to match the outline of the ghost.

<0097>A Starry Sky
<00><28><24><20><11><4C><1A><60><00><04><04><FF>
It's said that ancient peoples came up with
constellations by staring up at the stars
in the night sky. Here's a star-laden puzzle
to celebrate their achievements.

Below is a 6 x 6 grid of sky and stars
arranged into nine larger blocks. Arrange
these nine blocks so that each row and
column contains three stars. Blocks without
surrounding outlines can't be moved.
!******************************!
Brilliant!

The constellation is a bit...abstract, but
oh well.
!******************************!
Too bad!

There's at least one row or column in your
solution that doesn't have three stars.
!******************************!
You need to find a foothold to get
started, and the stars that are locked
in place should do nicely. Remember, if
two stars are locked into a row, you can
only place one more there.
!******************************!
The topmost row of blocks has two
blocks that are locked into place. Within
this row of blocks are two rows of
stars. The top row has two stars locked
in place and the bottom row has one.
Therefore, the one block you can place
in this row must have one star in its top
row and two in its bottom row.
!******************************!
Let's take a look at the leftmost
column of blocks, which also has two
blocks locked in place.
The left column of stars contained
here has only one star locked in place,
as does the right column. So, the block
that goes here must have two stars in
both its left and right rows.

<0098>Jars and Cans 1
<00><19><16><13><11><3A><1E><61><03><04><04><FF>
A long line of jars and cans sits on the
counter. Your job is to rearrange these
items so that both jars and cans are
grouped with items of the same type.
However, in doing so, you must always
move two containers at once.

Move items around by touching the red icon
between two containers and dragging the
selected pair of items around with the
stylus.
!******************************!
Well done!

Now the jars and cans are sorted neatly.
If only people would organise things
properly in the first place...
!******************************!
Too bad!
!******************************!
This puzzle is all about finding the right
order in which to make your moves.
The more organised players out there
should be able to solve this one on
instinct alone.

Since it's a relatively simple puzzle,
don't expect to find any more hints.
Instead, you'll get some trivia about
this type of puzzle. If you're short
on hint coins, stay away from the
last two hints!
!******************************!
This is another one of those puzzles
that's been around practically forever.
Variations of it exist across the globe
and have even been said to be played in
places like Edo-era Japan.
!******************************!
In Japan, this puzzle is often presented
using pieces from Go, a strategic
board game originally from China. In
England, the puzzle was often set up
using silver and gold coins.

Look at that, another row of jars and
cans all mixed up, and this time there are
even more of them. As before, your job is
to rearrange these items so that both jars
and cans are grouped with items of the
same type. However, in doing so, you
must always move two containers at once.

Move items around by touching the red icon
between two containers and dragging the
selected pair of items around with the
stylus.
!******************************!
Well done!

This puzzle is based on one widely known in
Japan since the Edo era.
!******************************!
Too bad!
!******************************!
This is another puzzle where the order
of your moves is key. You won't get any
hints on this one, but as a general tip
for this type of puzzle, you should take
care not to return items to their
original position while moving them
around. Also, you should know that
although there are a lot more jars and
cans this time, it shouldn't take any
more moves to solve than the last
puzzle.
!******************************!
In Japan the type of puzzle you are
playing now is known as a Mandarin duck
puzzle. Mandarin ducks are famous for
the affectionate way male and female
pairs of ducks get along. Some theorise
that the game is known by this name
because of the way Mandarin duck
couples tend to move about together.
!******************************!
Here's another piece of fun trivia
for you. As stated in Hint 2, these
puzzles are referred to as Mandarin
duck puzzles because of the
affectionate behaviour Mandarin duck
couples exhibit towards each other, but
it turns out that these birds change
mates every year!

This may not help you with the puzzle,
but isn't it interesting?

<0100>A Rickety Bridge
<00><1E><1B><18><11><4F><21><63><E9><03><04><FF>
Luke and Professor Layton stand at one
end of a rickety old bridge. Afraid of falling
into the chasm below, Luke's legs have
become stiff with fear, and he can only walk
across the bridge in increments of one or
three planks at a time. The narrowness of
the bridge prevents Luke from doubling
back the way he came or switching the foot
he's standing on before stepping forward.
Use your stylus to create a path that
guides Luke safely across the bridge, while
avoiding any gaps in the planks. Luke is safe
when he steps on the red footprint.
!******************************!
That was some fancy footwork!

The ninth step you choose gets Luke safely
across the bridge.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Watch your step!
!******************************!
The first step Luke takes is with his
left foot.
!******************************!
The last step Luke takes is with his
left foot. It carries him a distance of
one plank.

Luke's ninth step carries him to
the goal.
