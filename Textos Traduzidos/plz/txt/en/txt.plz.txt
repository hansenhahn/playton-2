I met the most enchanting girl at
the ball we held last night. These
parties are usually a complete
bore, but her presence changed
all that. As the duke's son, the
unfortunate reality is that most
people are overly polite and
fawning towards me. But this girl
was warm and real, and treated
me like she did everyone else.
It was very refreshing indeed.
I do hope to see her again.
!******************************!
[diary_10.txt]
My father fell ill from that
sickness and has passed away.
I also heard that many of the
people who left Folsense have
formed a village a safe distance
from town. I imagine she lives
there now, too. I've decided to
send her a letter. As duke, I can't
leave town, but I've entrusted my
message with a man who is
passing through town. Now, all I
can do is wait for her reply.
!******************************!
[diary_11.txt]
I don't know how many days have
passed, waiting to hear back from
her. It's been so long, in fact,
that I can barely remember even
sending that letter.
Maybe she really doesn't love me.
Maybe she's living in some other
town, happily married to another
man...
!******************************!
[diary_12.txt]
In order to deal with the swine who
sneak into Folsense by night like
rats to steal our gold, I have
decided to quite literally play the 
part of a monster. Though focused
on this, at times my thoughts turn
to that gilded box and the letter
inside. I now suspect that neither
made it to her.
Oh, my dear Sophia, just to hear
from you is all I desire.
!******************************!
[diary_2.txt]
I had the great fortune of bumping
into that girl from the ball again
today. She's the daughter of some
fancy lord or another, and it
shows. Her intellect is matched
only by the grace she displays.
To be honest, I'm quite taken with
her and have already started
courting her. However, I fear
that Father seems less than
pleased with the idea.
!******************************!
[diary_3.txt]
Father has always done what he
wants, regardless of who may
object. He's that way with
everyone, even his sons. It's no
wonder my younger brother always
seems so irritated with him. Even
so, he and I must endure Father's
whims because, as the next in line
to rule Folsense, we cannot leave
this town, even if we want to. We
are stewards of this town, and we
must stay here to watch over it. 
!******************************!
[diary_4.txt]
No longer able to tolerate
Father's selfish ways, my younger
brother has left Folsense for
good. Strangely enough, Father
doesn't seem affected by it at all.
If anything, he only seems more
focused on excavating even more
gold from the mine. Is that
miserable ore worth so much to
him? I'm beginning to think that I
will never understand that man.
!******************************!
[diary_5.txt]
We've found a new ore down in
the ground that Father thinks we
can refine into a precious metal.
Personally, I doubt we'll be able to
turn something as dull and dead
as that rock into something of
worth. Not that it's stopped
Father. The digging has advanced
to the point where it's formed a
massive crater under the castle.
I have visions of the whole castle
tumbling down into that abyss. 
!******************************!
[diary_6.txt]
Today is a day to celebrate!
At long last, the girl I love has
agreed to give me her hand in
marriage. I must begin preparing
for her arrival at once! I'll gladly
change every fixture and fitting
in the castle so that she feels
at ease. I'm also commissioning a
special dress to be made for her.
She's going to look stunning in it.
I just know it.
!******************************!
[diary_7.txt]
All around town, people are falling 
ill with a disease that has no name.
Some of the common folk have been
saying that our town has fallen
under a curse. As the only son
remaining to watch over Folsense,
I can't even think of leaving. The
thought would be more disturbing
were it not for her. As long as
she's by my side, I have the
strength to stay and protect this
town.
!******************************!
[diary_8.txt]
Oh, this wretched life of mine!
The girl I love and to whom I was
betrothed has abandoned me and
fled Folsense. Did all that awful
talk of curses scare her off? Or
did she truly leave me to be with
someone else she loves? Either
way, her betrayal cuts me to the
core. I trusted her, and now I'm
lost. Where do I go from here?
What's left for me?
!******************************!
[diary_9.txt]
Ever since she left, Father and I
have been at each other's throats
day and night.
The mysterious disease plaguing
our town continues to drive people
to flee their homes for a safer
life elsewhere. If only she had
stayed with me, I feel like I could
have weathered the storm. I still
ask myself why she left this town.
If she truly loved me, then why did
she leave?

It turns out that the Elysian Box
was crafted 50 years ago to
carry a letter from Anton to his
love, Sophia. A gas present in the
material used to make the box
causes hallucinations in those who
open it. These visions are how the
rumours of a curse began.
!******************************!
[ide_10.txt]
The symbol is actually a crest
belonging to the Herzen family,
who once ruled over Folsense.
It's clear that the Herzen family
and the Elysian Box are deeply
connected.
!******************************!
[ide_2.txt]
The ticket was for Folsense,
a destination accessible only
to those riding in a particular
carriage on the Molentary
Express. It would seem that
Dr Schrader must have
visited Folsense sometime
before his murder.
!******************************!
[ide_3.txt]
When reconstructed, the
photograph depicts the
Elysian Box. On the lid of
the box is an ominous-looking
goat, which seems appropriate,
given the box's sinister
reputation.
!******************************!
[ide_4.txt]
The villain who made off with the
Elysian Box was none other than
Don Paolo, brilliant scientist and
Professor Layton's
self-proclaimed nemesis. To find
riches associated with the
antique, he disguised himself as
Flora and tailed Layton and Luke.
!******************************!
[ide_5.txt]
It turns out that Tom isn't a
child, as was originally thought,
but rather Babette's pet dog.
It would seem that Babette's
affection for Tom is so deep that
she considers him to be much more
than just a pet.
!******************************!
[ide_6.txt]
Katia is Sophia and Anton's
granddaughter. Katia set out
alone for Folsense to solve
a 50-year-old misunderstanding.
!******************************!
[ide_7.txt]
The hallucinogenic gas present in
Folsense's air caused Layton and
the others to imagine the station
as the gleaming edifice displayed
in the many photographs lining the
walls of the building.
!******************************!
[ide_8.txt]
Beluga was searching for the
Elysian Box, which he believed
contained clues regarding the
vast Herzen family fortune. As a
member of the Herzen family, he
felt entitled to any family riches,
though some people in Folsense
strongly objected to his claims.
!******************************!
[ide_9.txt]
Anton invented the whole vampire
story to scare off those who
would try to loot the Herzen
fortune. He did this by whisking
away all those who came too close
to the castle and setting them
free to run away once properly
scared.
!******************************!

A large, ominous symbol in the

While riding on the Molentary
Express, Babette's little boy,
Tom, manages to disappear.
If the shoe he left behind is any
indication, Tom must be a very
young child. Where could a child
that small have wandered off to
on his own?
!******************************!
[id_6.txt]
Katia is the only daughter of
Dropstone's most influential man,
Mr Anderson, and has boarded
the Molentary Express. Several
villagers came to see her off, yet
she travels alone. Where is Katia
headed, and why is she making the
journey there by herself?
!******************************!
[id_7.txt]
Minutes after Professor Layton,
Luke and Flora's arrival in
Folsense, the run-down train
station transforms into a
gleaming, ornately decorated
building right before their eyes.
What caused the sudden change to
the station's appearance?
!******************************!
[id_8.txt]
Beluga seems to be working Sammy
like a dog, sending him all over
town in a frantic search for some
unknown item. It's unclear why
Beluga would set up a secret
train line connected to Folsense,
but it's clear this item is very
important to him. What could it be?
!******************************!
[id_9.txt]
Rumours have surfaced regarding
a vampire said to live in the castle
at the edge of town. Terrified by
such talk, not a soul in Folsense
dares to go near the castle.
Could a vampire actually be living
up in Herzen Castle?

Hoje eu recebi uma carta do meu velho
amigo e mentor, Dr. Andrew Schrader.
De acordo com a sua carta, o bom
doutor finalmente conseguiu colocar as
mãos na Caixa Elísia, um sinistro
artefato também conhecido pelo nome
"Caixa de Pandora". Contudo, o jeito
com que a carta foi escrita me deixou
com um mau pressentimento. Decidi
visitá-lo e me certificar que está tudo
bem.
!******************************!
[d_10.txt]
The main event of the Dropstone
festival appears to be a livestock
competition featuring the finest
cattle from around the village. It
sounds like it will be quite fun, and
both Luke and Flora seem very
keen on attending, so I imagine
we'll return to the site of the
event when it gets under way.
!******************************!
[d_11.txt]
I learned something interesting
from Dorothea, a maid working
for Mr Anderson, a man who
seems to be an extremely
prominent figure in Dropstone.
It seems that Mr Anderson's
daughter is planning to take a
trip by herself, unbeknownst
to her father. All the servants in
Mr Anderson's employ appear to
be supporting his daughter in her
plan, but why all the secrecy?
!******************************!
[d_12.txt]
I finally spoke to Mr Anderson
at the site of the livestock
competition. It seems his mother-
in-law had searched for the
Elysian Box before her passing,
though Mr Anderson doesn't know
why she was so intent on finding
the box. It's clear to me now that
the Elysian Box and Dropstone are
inextricably linked to each other,
though I don't yet fully understand
why.
!******************************!
[d_13.txt]
Thanks to Luke, the livestock
competition concluded as planned.
On a separate note, the most
recent rumours I've heard in
Dropstone concern a mysterious
phantom town only accessible by
the Molentary Express. Once we're
back on the train, I'd like to give
the interior another thorough
examination to see if there might
not be some kernel of truth within
these rumours.
!******************************!
[d_14.txt]
Back at the station, I noticed a
large group of people bidding
farewell to a young woman
boarding our train all by herself.
I'm sure she was none other than
Mr Anderson's daughter, Katia.
Though she was travelling alone,
she didn't seem apprehensive at
all. No, she seemed quite focused.
I do wonder, though... Why has she
set out on her own and where is
she headed?
!******************************!
[d_15.txt]
While in the deluxe carriage of the
Molentary Express, Luke, Flora
and I were suddenly hit with an
overpowering urge to sleep. Luke
says he dreamed of one of the
train's carriages being swapped.
Was the clamour I heard while
asleep the sound of those
carriages changing places?
!******************************!
[d_16.txt]
Shortly after waking from my
sudden slumber, the conductor
announced that our next stop
was a town known as Folsense.
I find this odd, as I was sure our
next destination was the town of
Luxenbelle. It appears that the
carriage in which we fell asleep
really did change tracks and was
the only one from our original
train to reach this new
destination.
!******************************!
[d_17.txt]
Upon exiting the train in Folsense,
Flora began to complain of feeling
unwell. I imagine the cause of her
discomfort is simply fatigue,
caused by too much travel. While
I'm anxious to start an inspection
of our surroundings, Flora's
comfort must come first. There
must be a hotel around here where
she can rest.
!******************************!
[d_18.txt]
After locating and checking into
a hotel, Flora decided to stay
behind to recuperate while Luke
and I began an investigation in
town. Our first mission is to
locate any and all places that
appear to have a connection with
the Elysian Box.
!******************************!
[d_19.txt]
Beluga and Sam, the train's
conductor, are here in
Folsense as well. From what I can
tell, this isn't their first time
here. It's clear they're both
turning the town upside down in
search of something, but as to
what that something might be, I'm
still without a clue.
!******************************!
[d_2.txt]
Sem outras pistas para seguir, eu e
o Luke dicidimos embarcar no Molentary
Express com o bilhete que encontramos
no apartamento do doutor. Suspeito
que o doutor tenha embarcado nesse
luxuoso trem em algum momento, mas
não sei dizer aonde ele foi.
!******************************!
[d_20.txt]
While walking about town, Luke
and I came across a diary-like
book. The book is fitted with a
number of locks that prevent
me from reading the majority of
its contents. The cover is adorned
with a sinister-looking goat, which
has piqued my interest. I wonder
what, if any, significance it might
have.
!******************************!
[d_21.txt]
It seems that everyone has found
their way to Folsense. I just ran
into the inspector and Constable
Barton. The inspector explained
that they are in town collecting
information on the Elysian Box. If
I could just get him to cooperate
with me, we could learn a great
deal about this place in very little
time, but he seems determined to
work this case on his own.
!******************************!
[d_22.txt]
Through talking to a local
shopkeeper, we've learned of an
institution known as the Herzen
Museum. I believe that we might
find some information pertaining
to the Elysian Box there, and I
am planning to visit it next.
!******************************!
[d_23.txt]
Unfortunately the gate to the
Herzen Museum is locked, and for
the moment we have no way of
entering the place. I haven't any
way of ascertaining when the gate
will be opened, and so have decided
to delay visiting the museum.
For the time being, I'd like to
focus my efforts on gathering
information from the people of
Folsense. 
!******************************!
[d_24.txt]
I met a most unusual gentleman
named Geoff, who keeps himself
holed up in a tower. He believes
a vampire lives in the castle at
the edge of town and that he
must keep watch of the area to
keep the vampire from attacking
the townsfolk. Geoff has even
adorned the tower with
knick-knacks that he claims keep
the vampire at bay. I wonder if
there's any truth in his story.
!******************************!
[d_25.txt]
I just saw a number of photos
in the town photo shop that are
purported to be quite old. Yet,
each image appeared to be in
perfect condition and free of the
degradation that most photos
suffer over time. It's as if the
photo was taken only a week
before. Perhaps the shop's
proprietor has a special method
for preserving his photos.
!******************************!
[d_26.txt]
My conversations with the people
of Folsense have proved mostly
useless in providing any leads.
"Pandora's Box" seems to ring a
bell with some of them, but they
are very vague on the details.
As I feared, the only way to move
this investigation forwards is to
find a way into the Herzen Museum.
!******************************!
[d_27.txt]
Luke and I returned to the museum
to find the gate unlocked. Inside,
we found Mr Beluga and Sam in
the middle of a rather heated
discussion. I imagine they were
the ones who opened the gate.
It seems that Mr Beluga is also
searching for this box, and
judging from his rather
impassioned speech, it would seem
that it's of great importance to
him.
!******************************!
[d_28.txt]
I noticed a large symbol resembling
the head of a goat carved into the
floor of the museum courtyard.
It's the same symbol that adorns
that strange diary we picked up,
but I feel like I've seen it
somewhere else as well. I now
have several questions I need to
ask the inspector. I suppose it's
back to the hotel for us.
!******************************!
[d_29.txt]
How disappointing. I wanted to
take another look at that torn-up
photograph the inspector took
from the doctor's flat, but
it seems the fellow lost most of it.
The only way I'll ever get a look at
the thing is to retrace the 
inspector's path around town and
gather up the pieces. Bother!
!******************************!
[d_3.txt]
Como suspeitava, o vagão-restaurante
do Molentary Express é muito popular
com os passageiros e, apesar de
estarmos pacientemente esperando
vagar uma mesa, tenho a impressão de
que não iremos almoçar tão cedo. 
O garçom sugeriu que esperássemos
o horário do almoço passar no mirante
no último vagão. Acho que vou aceitar
a sugestão dele. 
!******************************!
[d_30.txt]
Inspector Chelmey believes he
dropped the remains of the photo
around the north-east area of
town. I was hoping we'd be able to
retrieve the photo scraps without
incident, but a large and rather
ill-tempered dog is barring the
only path to that part of town.
According to Luke, the dog wants
something to eat, so we'll have to
visit the town grocer and find
something for the grumpy fellow.
!******************************!
[d_31.txt]
To guard against the vampire
supposedly threatening the town,
the local grocer has draped his
shop in an alarming amount
of garlic. The smell in the shop is
the olfactory equivalent of being
slapped in the face. Whether or
not the garlic actually does keep
the vampire at bay is debatable.
However, it certainly seems to be
working on customers. 
!******************************!
[d_32.txt]
The grocer was kind enough to
part with a large leftover shank
and I believe it should suit our
purpose nicely. Now it's back to
the north-east part of town.
Hopefully, our little offering will
be enough to improve the dog's
foul mood.

!******************************!
[d_33.txt]
While out searching for scraps of
the photo, Luke and I encountered
Mr Anderson's daughter, Katia.
She, too, seems to be searching
for the box, but was unwilling to
part with any information on the
subject. Now, why would a girl like
her, from a good family and with
many friends, come out to a place
like this by herself?
!******************************!
[d_34.txt]
I just learned that the curator
of the Herzen Museum has been
out and about, looking for
something by order of the
museum's owner. That explains
why the place has been closed all
this time.

Interestingly enough, I've heard
that the museum's owner is none
other than Mr Beluga. The plot
thickens...
!******************************!
[d_35.txt]
One fellow in town claims to have
seen something resembling the last
of our missing photo scraps at the
gate at the west edge of town.
It may be gone already, but before
checking anywhere else I feel it'd
be prudent to visit the location
he mentioned.
!******************************!
[d_36.txt]
Reassembling the pieces of the
photo revealed an image of the
Elysian Box. Sitting on its jewel-
encrusted lid was that familiar
goat emblem. Shortly after, an
unfortunate gust blew away a
piece of the photograph, but now
that I've confirmed the image, I've
no further need of the entire
photo. Now I only need to discover
the connection between the box
and this town.
!******************************!
[d_37.txt]
Having finally seen the photograph
in its entirety, Luke and I were
just about to return to our 
investigation when Constable
Barton found us. Apparently, the
person behind Dr Schrader's
death has been found and our
presence is required at the hotel.
I'm anxious to return to my
investigation, but I suppose it's
not wise to defy the authorities
in a situation like this.
!******************************!
[d_38.txt]
It came as a great shock to me
that Don Paolo had been posing
as Flora for some time. Not being
able to sniff out an impostor
among those close to me is quite
an embarrassment. It seems that
poor Flora - the real Flora, that
is - has been left in a barn
somewhere in Dropstone. I must
solve this case quickly and return
to Dropstone to pick her up.
!******************************!
[d_39.txt]
In his panic to escape Inspector
Chelmey, Don Paolo left the
Elysian Box behind. I must confess
I never imagined that I'd come
across the box in this way, but
one must never look a gift horse in
the mouth. Now all I need to do is
solve the box's mystery.
!******************************!
[d_4.txt]
A vista do mirante do Molentary
Express é de cair o queixo. A beleza
natural encontrada aqui é uma das
coisas que dificilmente se acha morando
no coração de Londres. Quando vou
para o campo, o tempo simplesmente
parece desacelerar. Mesmo assim, não
posso me dar ao luxo de relaxar por
muito tempo. É hora de voltar à
investigação da Caixa Elísia.
!******************************!
[d_40.txt]
From what I understand, Mr Beluga
came to town in search of the
Elysian Box, believing it would lead
him to the vast Herzen fortune.
Katia seems to have come to town
in search of the box as well. I'm
still baffled as to why so many
people are after this box. I fear
that in order to answer this
question, I will simply have to
open the box and see for myself.
!******************************!
[d_41.txt]
After working up the courage,
Luke and I opened the box, but
nothing happened. This confirms
a suspicion I've had for some time
now. I feel this little test has
brought me one step closer to
understanding everything.
However, in order to comprehend
the entire matter, I'll need to
gather a bit more information.
!******************************!
[d_42.txt]
Thanks to a little help from
Sammy, we are finally able to
enter the Herzen Museum. I'm
almost certain that the Elysian
Box is connected to the Herzen
family, but in order to solidify my
theory I'll need to see what else
I can find out from viewing the
Herzen Museum's collection.
!******************************!
[d_43.txt]
Apparently, some miners in the
town gold mine used to keep
diaries. If I can find a first-hand
account of the town's past, I may
be able to understand the Elysian
Box more fully. But how can I find
such a diary? I suppose Luke and I
will have to visit the mine
for ourselves.
!******************************!
[d_44.txt]
Having finally stumbled upon a
miner's diary, I learned that
shortly after a strange ore was
found in Folsense, about 50
years ago, a mysterious illness
began to spread through town.
I believe  it was this illness that
first gave birth to rumours of a
curse. Sadly, the diary had little
else to offer in the way of
information. Just what happened
here in the last 50 years?
!******************************!
[d_45.txt]
The time I've spent in town
investigating Folsense's
history has given me most of the
pieces to the puzzle, but some
facts still elude me. To answer
those remaining questions, Luke
and I have but one option
remaining to us: we must head
out for Herzen Castle.
!******************************!
[d_46.txt]
Luke claims to have seen a
ghost lurking in the forest.
Personally, I believe his sighting
to be nothing more than a trick
of the light, but I can't blame
him for being jumpy. After all,
this town has been full of
inexplicable happenings. But the
question now is how these
happenings connect with the
rumour that the town is cursed.
!******************************!
[d_47.txt]
Anton, the current duke of Herzen
Castle, welcomed us to his home
with food and drink. I asked him
about the Elysian Box, but the
questioning proved futile as he
claimed not to know much about
the relic. I don't think pressing him
further will yield any more
information. Anton has offered to
let us stay the night, and I believe
we'll take him up on the offer.
!******************************!
[d_48.txt]
I awoke from a nightmare to find
myself and Luke tied up in the
corner of a strange, musty room.
Before I could make sense of our
situation, in walked Anton.
Hovering over us like a spider with
its next meal ensnared in its web,
Anton spoke of the preparations
he had to make in order to have
us for dinner! Luke and I must find
a way out of these ropes before
he returns, or else...
!******************************!
[d_49.txt]
The ropes that bound us were
easier to undo than I expected.
Considering Anton slipped these
ropes around us while we were in
the middle of that strange
nightmare, one would think that he
would have had the time to tie a
proper knot... But enough on that
subject, as Luke and I must now
focus on escaping this place.

!******************************!
[d_5.txt]
While walking through the train,
Luke and I encountered a lady by
the name of Babette. This woman,
large in both stature and
character, was in a dreadful panic
over her lost boy, Tom. It seems
the child got away from her while
she was distracted, leaving only
a single tiny shoe behind. Where
could a child that small have
wandered off to?
!******************************!
[d_50.txt]
In passing through the space
under the castle, Luke and I
stumbled upon a number of
machines identical to those we saw
down in the mine. I believe the
castle and mine are actually
connected through this
underground area. I haven't the
time to explore it further at
present, but we may have just
wandered into the heart of this
town's great secret...
!******************************!
[d_51.txt]
By some stroke of luck we
managed to make it as far as the
castle's main doors, but I realised
that leaving now means leaving
behind what may be my only
chance to solve the mystery of
Andrew's untimely death and the
Elysian Box. Until I completely
understand the phenomena at
work here, I must stay and
investigate the castle.
!******************************!
[d_52.txt]
Imagine my surprise to find Katia
here in Herzen Castle! I don't know
why she's here, but I'm beginning
to sense a link between the
Herzens and this young woman.
Then there's the matter of the
portrait I saw in our guest room
here. It was of a young woman
who was the spitting image of
Katia. But how can that be?
!******************************!
[d_53.txt]
Anton spotted us in the castle's
great hall and, upon seeing Katia,
seemed to lose all reason. For a
reason I don't understand, he
lunged at me with his sword.
Luckily, I was able to fend him off
with a nearby saber. Despite being
the very image of health, Anton
began to lose his breath, almost
hyperventilating, within seconds
of our duel's start. It's just as I
suspected...
!******************************!
[d_54.txt]
Katia has finally explained her
involvement in this whole affair.
She is Anton's granddaughter.
Sadly, Anton responded rather
poorly to this revelation, and in a
fit of madness, began destroying
the castle. The place now seems on
the verge of crumbling, and while
there's much left to discuss, our
first priority is to escape with
everyone before the
whole place comes down.
!******************************!
[d_55.txt]
A hallucinogenic gas released from
the mine has been playing tricks on
us the whole time, making the ruins
of Folsense appear alive and
vibrant. It seems that traces of
this same gas are emitted by the
Elysian Box, causing terrifying
visions for those who open it and
leading to comparisons with the
mythical Pandora's Box. It is this
gas that started the legends
surrounding the box and the town.
!******************************!
[d_56.txt]
With the castle wreckage now
blocking the source of the gas,
the Anton we'd been hallucinating
faded, and the real Anton was
revealed to be an aging man
in his twilight years. Upon
returning the box to him, he spoke
to us of a second way to open the
Elysian Box, and after giving Luke
a rather cryptic hint, asked him to
open it. It seems we're about to
discover what's hidden in the box.
!******************************!
[d_57.txt]
A single letter in delicate script
sat within the hidden chamber of
the box. It was a reply to the
message Anton had sent out to
Sophia years ago.
Sophia's message asked Anton to
spend what time he had left alive
with his granddaughter, Katia.
After so many years of living in
sorrow, it seems Anton has a
reason to delight in life again.

!******************************!
[d_6.txt]
The clues we've uncovered during
our search have led me to believe
there's a strong possibility that
Tom is actually a dog, not a small
child as we had originally thought.
Come to think of it, I seem to
recall a young girl walking about
the train with a dog in her arms.
I intend to find her and confirm my
suspicions.
!******************************!
[d_7.txt]
We discovered that the young girl
carrying little Tom around was
none other than Flora!
Though I've consented to Flora
accompanying Luke and myself
on our investigation, I still worry
that this may expose her to some
unknown danger.

But there's no time to dwell on
that. Babette needs to know
that her "boy" is alive and well. 
!******************************!
[d_8.txt]
A short while ago, the train came
to a sudden and rather alarming
stop to avoid crashing into
another train lying abandoned on
the tracks.
!******************************!
[d_9.txt]
Our train is currently stopped in
a quaint country village named
Dropstone. The village is currently
celebrating the 50th anniversary
of its founding, and the whole
place is bustling with activity.
With a while to go before our
departure, I've decided to use our
free time to search the village for
any leads on the Elysian Box.

C'mon, passengers, let me hear
you scream!
!******************************!
[m10_3.txt]
Folsense, eh?
!******************************!
[m10_4.txt]
Of course! How could I have
missed this?
!******************************!
[m10_5.txt]
Do you recall how this ticket was
missing a destination?
!******************************!
[m10_6.txt]
Well, it seems that the destination
was staring us in the face all along.
!******************************!
[m10_8.txt]
Really?
!******************************!
[m10_9.txt]
But where, Professor?
!******************************!
[m11_0.txt]
I get it!
!******************************!
[m11_1.txt]
I suppose that means we've almost
reached our destination.
!******************************!
[m11_2.txt]
Yes.
!******************************!
[m11_3.txt]
Whoa! This is strange. 
!******************************!
[m11_4.txt]
When did it get so dark?
!******************************!
[m11_5.txt]
What do you mean?
!******************************!
[m12_0.txt]
Hm?
!******************************!
[m12_1.txt]

!******************************!
[m12_10.txt]
I don't know, but it's strange!
!******************************!
[m12_11.txt]

!******************************!
[m12_2.txt]
What on earth?
!******************************!
[m12_3.txt]
Professor, what was that?
!******************************!
[m12_4.txt]
Let's go!
!******************************!
[m12_5.txt]
Oh, my...
!******************************!
[m12_6.txt]

must be YOU there!

Stop talking in circles and get
to the point, Layton!
!******************************!
[m13_5.txt]
Who should be wearing the
handcuffs?
!******************************!
[m13_6.txt]
Isn't it obvious?
!******************************!
[m13_7.txt]
If the criminal does indeed reside
in our midst...
!******************************!
[m13_8.txt]
He or she would be the only one of us
to see the Elysian Box in person.
!******************************!
[m13_9.txt]
Which means the culprit...
!******************************!
[m14_0.txt]
Finally, the Elysian Box.
!******************************!
[m14_1.txt]
Indeed, Luke.
!******************************!
[m14_2.txt]
I can't look!
!******************************!
[m14_3.txt]
Huh?
!******************************!
[m15_0.txt]
Wow, this place is really
something else!
!******************************!
[m15_1.txt]
Indeed, Luke. This castle is
extremely impressive.
!******************************!
[m15_10.txt]
It seems that the design on this box
!******************************!
[m15_11.txt]
is connected to your family in
some way.
!******************************!
[m15_12.txt]
Can you...tell me anything
about this?
!******************************!
[m15_13.txt]
It's true that it was a Herzen
family heirloom,
!******************************!
[m15_15.txt]
although I parted with it a number
of years ago.
!******************************!
[m15_16.txt]
The garish emblem you mentioned
wasn't exactly suited to my taste.
!******************************!
[m15_17.txt]
The garish emblem you mentioned
wasn't exactly suited to my taste.
!******************************!
[m15_18.txt]
Personally, I think it's quite
spectacular.
!******************************!
[m15_19.txt]
Oh, is that so?
!******************************!
[m15_2.txt]
Right this way, please. 
!******************************!
[m15_20.txt]
Well, chalk it up to my bad
taste then.
!******************************!
[m15_21.txt]
You know,
!******************************!
[m15_22.txt]
I don't think he's telling us the
whole story. 
!******************************!
[m15_23.txt]
Perhaps not. It's hard to say
just yet.
!******************************!
[m15_24.txt]
I'm sorry I'm not much help, though
I confess
!******************************!
[m15_25.txt]
visitors are always delightful.
!******************************!
[m15_26.txt]
I'm sure you've had a long journey.

!******************************!
[m15_27.txt]
So please, do stay the night.
!******************************!
[m15_28.txt]
Prepare the quarters for our
guests, Nigel.
!******************************!
[m15_3.txt]

!******************************!
[m15_30.txt]
Yes. Right away, Master.
!******************************!
[m15_4.txt]
Welcome to my house.
!******************************!
[m15_5.txt]
So, if I understand correctly,
!******************************!
[m15_6.txt]
you're saying people fear the box
!******************************!
[m15_7.txt]
because they believe it kills
anyone who opens it? 
!******************************!
[m15_8.txt]
<HOLD>
!******************************!
[m15_9.txt]
That's quite a story, isn't it?
!******************************!
[m16_0.txt]
What?
!******************************!
[m16_1.txt]
Professor...
!******************************!
[m16_10.txt]
Wha-?
!******************************!
[m16_11.txt]
Hmm...
!******************************!
[m16_2.txt]
Is that Katia?
!******************************!
[m16_3.txt]
The resemblance is striking.
!******************************!
[m16_4.txt]
What are they doing together?
!******************************!
[m16_5.txt]
Oh!
!******************************!
[m16_6.txt]
Fear not, my dear.
!******************************!
[m16_7.txt]
They're just the main course for
this evening.
!******************************!
[m16_8.txt]
And my, don't they look fresh.
!******************************!
[m16_9.txt]

!******************************!
[m17_0.txt]
This won't do.
!******************************!
[m17_1.txt]
People are trying to sleep, you know.
!******************************!
[m17_10.txt]
Come closer. My dear, sweet Sophia!
!******************************!
[m17_11.txt]
I've missed you so!
!******************************!
[m17_12.txt]

!******************************!
[m17_13.txt]
What's this?
!******************************!
[m17_14.txt]
Very well then.
!******************************!
[m17_15.txt]
Is this how it is?
!******************************!
[m17_16.txt]
I didn't see this coming, Layton.
!******************************!
[m17_17.txt]
Not at all.
!******************************!
[m17_18.txt]
<HOLD>
!******************************!
[m17_19.txt]
I'm not sure I understand.
!******************************!
[m17_2.txt]

!******************************!
[m17_20.txt]
This is your fault!
!******************************!
[m17_21.txt]
But you can't have my Sophia!
!******************************!
[m17_22.txt]
You're going to be very sorry you
crossed me.
!******************************!
[m17_23.txt]
There's no lack of swords here.
!******************************!
[m17_24.txt]
Take whichever one you like.
!******************************!
[m17_25.txt]
Know this though.
!******************************!
[m17_26.txt]
Only one of them
!******************************!
[m17_27.txt]
is real.
!******************************!
[m17_28.txt]
A true warrior always keeps his
blade in hand.
!******************************!

[m17_4.txt]
It can't be!
!******************************!
[m17_5.txt]
Oh, how I've waited!
!******************************!
[m17_6.txt]
It's been so unbearably long...
!******************************!
[m17_8.txt]
Professor, do you know what he's
talking about?
!******************************!
[m17_9.txt]
Not in the slightest.
!******************************!
[m18_0.txt]
I didn't think you had it in you,
Mr Layton.
!******************************!
[m18_1.txt]
LAAAAYTON!
!******************************!
[m18_10.txt]
What's happened to me?
!******************************!
[m18_11.txt]
Are you all right?
!******************************!
[m18_12.txt]
Please just stop, Grandfather.
!******************************!
[m18_13.txt]
Your body can't take it.
!******************************!
[m18_14.txt]
What did you say?
!******************************!
[m18_15.txt]
I don't understand.
!******************************!
[m18_16.txt]
Sophia, dear...
!******************************!
[m18_17.txt]

[m18_7.txt]
I just need to catch my breath.
!******************************!
[m18_8.txt]
No more!
!******************************!
[m18_9.txt]
Please, just stop!
!******************************!
[m19_0.txt]
Sophia is dead?

No, it can't be!

[m19_4.txt]
Oh!

What's happening?

Ei, olhe, chegamos!

[m1_1.txt]
Isso sim que é luxo!

[m1_11.txt]
Todos que a abrem morrem?

[m1_12.txt]
Isso me parece bizarro demais.
!******************************!
[m1_13.txt]
Talvez seja.
!******************************!
[m1_14.txt]
Mas nós vimos acontecer com nossos
próprios olhos.
!******************************!
[m1_15.txt]
A resposta está aí fora, Luke.
!******************************!
[m1_16.txt]
Tenho apenas que encontrá-la.

[m21_0.txt]
Grandfather...
!******************************!
[m21_1.txt]
"Grandfather"? Yes, that's right.
!******************************!
[m21_10.txt]
Instead, my love for Sophia was
replaced by anger
!******************************!
[m21_12.txt]
and that anger completely blinded me.
!******************************!
[m21_13.txt]
But now I can see the world
clearly again.
!******************************!
[m21_14.txt]
Thanks to you, my granddaughter.
!******************************!
[m21_15.txt]

!******************************!

Are you listening, Sophia?
!******************************!
[m21_17.txt]
I'll have to put off returning to your
side for a while.
!******************************!
[m21_19.txt]
There's someone I need to get to
know here first.
!******************************!
[m21_2.txt]
It has a nice ring to it.

Will you forgive me for making you

You don't know how much this

After all, Luke.

His two passions are
solving puzzles and
enjoying a good cup of
tea. While his job is
teaching archaeology,
he is also quite the
fencer. Many wonder
what's under the hat,
but only the professor
knows the answer
to that mystery.
!******************************!
[chr_1.txt]
As the self-proclaimed
apprentice of the
professor, Luke is
generally sweet and
earnest, but, like all
boys his age, can
occasionally let slip
a cheeky comment.
His unique way with
animals has come in
handy more than once.

Beluga is the demanding
owner and founder of
the Molentary Express.
He chases after the 
Elysian Box in the hope
it will lead him to the 
Herzen family fortune,
which he believes he
is entitled to as a son
of the former duke and
brother to Anton.
!******************************!
[chr_11.txt]
Beluga's nephew, Sammy,
has only one thing on
his mind: pedal-to-the-
metal rock and roll. By
day, he's just a normal
train conductor, but
once he grips the mike,
he transforms into his
wild, rock-star alter
ego, Sammy Thunder.
!******************************!
[chr_12.txt]
Macaroon is the chef
on the Molentary
Express. While quite
trim in his younger
days, years of testing
his own dishes have

food is so good that
many people ride the
Molentary Express just
to experience his magic.
!******************************!
[chr_13.txt]
Peek into the Molentary
Express's dining car

His commitment to

lavish reputation.
!******************************!
[chr_14.txt]
Babette is the pompous
wife of a moneyed man.
Her aim in life is to make
everyone around her

special treatment.
A long-time fan of the
Molentary Express
dining car, she can
often be spotted there
coddling her dog, Tom.
!******************************!
[chr_15.txt]
This petite canine is the
beloved pet of Babette.
Raised in the lap of
luxury, Tom often gets
up to mischief, causing
trouble for those
around him. Despite
being the apple of
Babette's eye, he
doesn't seem very
fond of her.

[chr_16.txt]
Vera is the glamorous

High in the watchtower,
Geoff keeps an eye
fixed on Herzen Castle

Some say that fighting
evil is just his way of
trying to impress Vera.

This town grocer fears
vampires so much that
he's smothered his shop

increase day by day.

Though sinister looking,

Despite his appearance,
Inspector Chelmey's
assistant, Constable

Grousley is one of the
many passengers on the
Molentary Express.
While he may not look

He gets inspiration from
the natural scenery
he sees on train rides.

As the mechanic on the

There's something
childlike and scattered
about Capone, as
illustrated by the
questionable information
he provides when Tom
disappears. As
unbelievable as it
sounds, Capone is
actually a CEO of a big
corporation.
!******************************!
[chr_25.txt]
Mitzi is Capone's chatty

Felix works on the door
at one of Folsense's
chicest restaurants.
Felix strictly enforces
the restaurant's
no-hat policy, but the
irony of the situation is
that Felix actually has
the most extensive hat
collection in Folsense.
!******************************!
[chr_54.txt]
Niles is just a regular
kid who likes to play,
but almost everyone
left in Folsense is an
adult. Since he has no
one to play with, poor
Niles just gobbles 
Citronia Seeds until his
fingers turn orange.
Duke is his older
brother.
!******************************!
[chr_55.txt]
Though it can seem like
Duke talks down to
people, it's actually
just the unfortunate
way he holds his face
that makes him seem
that way. His softer
side comes out when
he's with his little
brother, Niles.
!******************************!
[chr_56.txt]
Fun-loving and spiky-
haired Hopper is always
out to have a good time.
Because of this, he's a
walking guidebook of
Folsense's hot spots
and restaurants.
Recently, though, his
rock 'n' roll lifestyle
seems to be taking
its toll.
!******************************!
[chr_57.txt]
Olson doesn't draw much
attention from people,
and he isn't one for
cracking jokes. His
eyesight is so bad that,
even with his glasses on,
the illusion of Folsense
could melt away and
Olson wouldn't notice
any difference.

!******************************!
[chr_58.txt]
Derby is one of those
rare people who
moved into Folsense.
He's aware of the
town's strange nature
but appears to be
happy enough just
ignoring the odd
happenings.
Apparently, living in a
ghost town suits him.
!******************************!
[chr_59.txt]
Dawson runs the antique
shop in town and gets
most excited over items
with historical meaning
or personal stories
attached to them. Items
whose only significance
is their monetary value
don't get his juices
flowing.
!******************************!
[chr_6.txt]
Anton, the current duke
of Folsense, is rumoured
to be a vampire.
Fifty years ago, Anton
was separated from his
love, Sophia, a blow from
which he never truly
recovered.
He is also the elder
brother of Beluga.
!******************************!
[chr_60.txt]
Joanie's a sweet little
girl with a penchant for
being straight with
people. Her fearless
attitude has made her
very popular with the
tougher crowd up in
the north-east part of
town. She loves all
things cute.
!******************************!
[chr_61.txt]
Krantz works on the
front desk at the
Folsense hotel and has
many fond memories of
the Herzen family. Over
the years, all the hotel
staff fled Folsense,
leaving Krantz to run
the whole operation
by himself.
!******************************!
[chr_62.txt]
Grinko's main job is
Herzen Museum curator,
but his employer, Beluga,
often sends him around
town to sniff out leads
on the Elysian Box.
Grinko is one of the few
people in town who
fully comprehends many
of the town's secrets.

!******************************!
[chr_63.txt]
Marina is the daughter
of the garlic-crazed
grocer, Garland. If you
ever doubt that the
two are related, just
take a whiff of the
snacks she carries
around with her. They
smell of garlic too.
!******************************!
[chr_64.txt]
One of the few remaining
members of Folsense's
aristocracy, Opal lives
in the lap of luxury on
the north side of town
with her husband. She
secretly dreams of a
more down-to-earth
life, which is why she
sewed her favourite
mustard-yellow dress
herself.
!******************************!
[chr_65.txt]
Ray hangs out on the
edge of town, wearing
sunglasses at night.
He enjoys looking like a
tough guy, but when the
glasses come off he
gets so shy that he
won't even venture out
into the street.
!******************************!
[chr_66.txt]
There have been many
chess fans throughout
history, but few love
chess like Gregorio.
His love for chess
extends to the decor of
his house, which,
naturally, consists of
alternating pieces of
black-and-white
furniture.
!******************************!
[chr_67.txt]
Clarice is always out
chasing the latest
report of paranormal
activity. Nothing thrills
her more than sitting
quietly in the latest
ghost-spotting site,
waiting for something
creepy to drift by.
!******************************!
[chr_68.txt]
If you're craving
pancakes in Folsense,
visit Gertie. The
pancakes she flips
consistently score
full marks for taste,
but never seem to
come out the same
size, much to her
chagrin.
!******************************!
[chr_69.txt]
Why, it's our old friend
Mr Stachenscarfen!
Where'd he come from?
He has a strange habit
of suddenly appearing,
only to vanish moments
later. Where he'll show
up tomorrow is as much
of a mystery as his
identity.

!******************************!
[chr_7.txt]
Katia is the daughter
of Dropstone's Mr
Anderson, though the
two haven't been
getting along recently.
Katia goes to Folsense
to deliver a message
from her grandmother,
Sophia, to Anton,
her grandfather.
!******************************!
[chr_70.txt]
A man of contradictions,
Pavel is a fearless
adventurer with no
sense of direction. He
was on his way to Egypt
when he somehow ended
up in Folsense. He has a
talent for getting into
forbidding places, but
he has no clue how he
does it.
!******************************!
[chr_71.txt]
Puzzle savant and
all-round know-it-all
Granny Riddleton has
the uncanny ability to
store puzzles that Luke
and Layton didn't grab
on their adventure.
She's never without her
trademark hat and tiny
shack, where she keeps
the lost puzzles.
!******************************!
[chr_72.txt]
With Luke's help, this
little fellow managed to
get in shape. However,
the mountain of
delectable food scraps
back at home proved to
be too tempting, and
upon returning to the
train the poor hamster
returned to his old,
sedentary ways.
!******************************!
[chr_73.txt]
Precious guards the
path to the north-east
part of Folsense. He's
very wary of strangers,
but is by no means an
aggressive dog. In fact,
he warms to you
awfully quickly if you
bring him a snack.
!******************************!
[chr_74.txt]
The Molentary Express
is owned by Beluga,
the railroad tycoon.
It's famous for its
luxury, earning it the
title of the world's only
cruise ship on rails.
Just a few passengers
know that it also has
a secret second route
that goes to Folsense.
!******************************!
[chr_75.txt]
Puzzle Lad One livens up
puzzles with his endless
energy and dashing
moustache. Back in the
day, he was quite
athletic and popular
with the ladies. He's put
on a few pounds since
then, but still knows how
to add flair to puzzles
with his athletic poses.
!******************************!
[chr_76.txt]
Famous for his bushy
beard, Puzzle Lad Two is
considered the poster
boy for all the members
of the puzzle troupe. He
is an accomplished
entertainer capable of
many different feats. 
You'll rarely spot him
without his broom and
other props.
!******************************!
[chr_77.txt]
Puzzle Lad Three is a
middle-aged gent who
believes that you don't
need to show off to do
a great job. The skill he
brings to his craft
makes other puzzle lads
and lasses look up to
him like a father. Apart
from puzzles, his other
passion is napping.
!******************************!
[chr_78.txt]
The identity of this
puzzle lad is shrouded
in mystery. Some whisper
that he secretly rules
over puzzles from the
shadows, though no one
is certain. Puzzle Lad
Four is extremely
intelligent and can beat
almost anyone in a
battle of wits.
!******************************!
[chr_79.txt]
Puzzle Lad Five believes
his best feature is his
dapper little moustache.
While he's not yet as
skilled as the other
puzzle lads and lasses,
he has the market
cornered when it comes
to dedication. No one
tackles puzzles with his
kind of positivity.
!******************************!
[chr_8.txt]
Sophia was Katia's
grandmother and
Anton's former fianc<'e>e.
In order to protect the
child growing inside her,
she left behind her life
in Folsense to start
afresh in the fledgling
village of Dropstone.
Kind and honest, she was
loved by all.
!******************************!
[chr_80.txt]
Puzzle Lass One is all
about sporting the
hottest looks and
keeping up with the
latest trends. One such
trend is telling people
to "talk to the hand,"
which has been her
new thing of late.
!******************************!
[chr_81.txt]
Puzzle Lass Two has a
devilish nature and is
great at convincing
people to do stuff for
her. Despite this, no one
can seem to get angry
with her. Perhaps she
should consider a
career in diplomacy.
!******************************!
[chr_82.txt]
Puzzle Lass Three is the
most dependable of the
bunch and helps to
organise things in the
puzzle-actor community.
In the future she'd like
to be a music teacher,
but there's a slight
hole in her plan: the
poor thing can't carry
a tune in a bucket.
!******************************!
[chr_83.txt]
Puzzle Lass Four has
the single unfortunate
habit of inserting
herself into every
conversation around
her. Some people see
her as nosy, but she
is only trying to be
friendly.
!******************************!
[chr_84.txt]
In a sea of strangeness,
Puzzle Lass Five stands
out as decidedly normal.
She's good at having
fun in almost every
situation, no matter how
mundane. She considers
her best feature to be
her snappy taste in
accessories.
!******************************!
[chr_85.txt]
Flora must have thought
a scarf and sunglasses
would be enough to
disguise her identity.
Of course, anyone who
knows her should have
recognised her in an
instant, but for some
strange reason, neither
Layton nor Luke saw 
through her disguise.
!******************************!
[chr_86.txt]
Don't be fooled. While
this may look like Flora,
it is actually Don
Paolo in another of his
masterful disguises. He
swapped places with
the real Flora to spy
on Luke and Layton.
He's such a master of
mimicry that he's even
got her walk spot on.
!******************************!
[chr_87.txt]
Duke Herzen is Anton
and Beluga's father, as
well as the man who
discovered Folsense's
gold deposit and made
the town rich. Unyielding
and stubborn, he never
got along well with his
sons, but was only
trying to do what he
thought was best.
!******************************!
[chr_88.txt]
Winston is the Anderson
family's devoted
chauffeur. When seeing
Katia off on her
journey to Folsense,
one wonders if he felt
a twinge of jealousy,
however irrational, at
her decision to travel
by rail instead of by
car.
!******************************!
[chr_89.txt]
Layton's pride and joy
is an ode to classic
design, cast in shiny
red metal. He keeps the
car in tip-top shape, so
it looks great whenever
he takes it out to solve
a new mystery. Its tall
roof affords Layton
the headroom he needs
to drive with his hat on.
!******************************!
[chr_9.txt]
Mr Anderson is Katia's
father and a popular
and beloved figure in
Dropstone.
A gentle soul, he has
recently been fretting
about the growing divide
between himself and
his daughter.
