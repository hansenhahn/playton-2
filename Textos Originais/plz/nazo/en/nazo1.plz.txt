<0001>Dr Schrader's Map
<02><0A><09><08><12><5B><1A><01><00><04><01><FF>
Several pieces have been cut out of the
middle of the map to Dr Schrader's home.
Complete the map by sliding the pieces with
the stylus and inserting them in the right 
places.

It may sound simple, but don't forget that
you can move or remove pieces, including the
one already in the middle of the map.
!******************************!
Excellent work!

Now, let's hurry to the doctor's flat!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Read the puzzle carefully and try again.
!******************************!
Including the one piece that's in the
middle of the map from the start, you
have six pieces to move around but only
five spaces to place them in.

This means one of the pieces is not
actually part of the map.
!******************************!
Take a close look at the missing pieces
and the rest of the map. If you connect
the road patterns at the edges of the
pieces with those at the edges of the
missing spaces, you won't go wrong.
!******************************!
Did you notice that the piece positioned
in the middle of the map at the start of
the puzzle doesn't belong to the map,
and isn't part of the solution?

Now all you have to do is sort out the
other five pieces.

The forest below contains four different
types of trees. Use the stylus to divide the
forest into four sections, each containing
one of each type of tree.
!******************************!
Very nice!

Now take a moment to admire the gorgeous
scenery!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Don't panic if you get stuck. Just look for
areas where all four types of trees are
connected one after the other.
!******************************!
If you find two of the same type of tree
next to each other, then you know that
those two trees must be separated by a
line.

That should get you started.
!******************************!
Let's focus on the trees in the
bottom-left part of the picture. If you
drew lines according to the information
in Hint 1, this section of the picture
should be easy to work out. The section
you create should have an L shape.
!******************************!
The tree in the top-left corner and
the one to its immediate right belong
to different sections. The same goes
for the tree in the top-right corner
and the one directly below it.

Use these hints as stepping stones to
solve the rest of the puzzle.

<0012>Clouds and Sky
<01><1E><1B><18><11><10><1C><0B><F6><03><02><01>
A man on the train shows you a picture he's
painted.

<''>Let's say this picture has a total area of
10. Can you work out how much of it is made
up of clouds compared to the area that's
made up of sky? Don't think you need to
guess the answer. There's a #rdefinite
method#x you can use to work this out.<''>

How much of the area is sky and how much is
cloud?
!******************************!
Nice job!

The key here is to use the screws on the
frame to divide the picture. Once you do
that, it should be clear that B and F, C
and I, D and G, and E and H are all simply
pairs of the same drawings with the
colours reversed. This means that in these
eight areas there are 4 squares' worth of
cloud and 4 of sky. The remaining two
squares, A and J, are completely blue, so
the totals are 6 squares of sky and 4
squares of cloud.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Take another long, careful look at the
puzzle.
!******************************!
Take a closer look... Not at the picture
itself, but at its frame.

You could use the frame's screws to
simplify how you look at the picture.
!******************************!
Hint 1 pointed out the screws in the
picture frame. Have you noticed that
you can use these as guides to divide
the picture into 10 squares.

Now all you have to do is study the
squares carefully...
!******************************!
Compare each square with the others.
Have you noticed that some squares are
identical in design, but with the
colours swapped? Any such pair of
squares you find have the same amount
of sky and cloud. Also, don't forget
about the two squares that are filled
with just one colour.

up of two equilateral triangles, one inside

Can you work out how many times bigger the
large triangle is than the small one?
!******************************!
That's right!

If you imagine that the small triangle is
inverted as shown, it should only take a
moment to realise that four small triangles
would fit into the larger one.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Focus your attention on the small triangle.
!******************************!
You don't need to do any kind of special
calculation here. In fact, all you need
is a little intuition.
!******************************!
How would things look if you rotated the
smaller triangle?
!******************************!
Did you try visualising what things would
look like if you rotated the smaller
triangle?

If you've done that, it should be easy to
see how many smaller triangles fit in the
larger one.

<0014>Red Caps
<01><19><16><13><11><0C><16><0D><F6><03><02><FF>
A teacher had everyone in her class close
their eyes. While none of the students were
looking, she slipped caps onto their heads,
and said:

<''>OK, everyone, open your eyes and look at
your friends' caps. Whoever sees four or
more people wearing red caps gets a red
balloon, and whoever doesn't gets a blue
balloon.<''>

In a class of 10 children, only some got a
red balloon. But how many?
!******************************!
That's right!

You know that only some children got red
balloons. If five or more children were
wearing a red cap, every child in the class
would see at least four red caps and get a
red balloon, so it must be fewer than five.
But if three or fewer children were wearing
red caps, no one would see four red caps.

Therefore, four children must have had red
caps, meaning that the other six children
received red balloons.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think hard about the puzzle and try again.
!******************************!
The puzzle says that some of the
children received red balloons. This
means some children saw four or more
red caps.

If there were, say, three children
wearing red caps, then no one would
get a red balloon.

So there must be four or more children
wearing red caps.
 
!******************************!
The puzzle says that #rsome#x of the
children received a red balloon.

By definition, therefore, not all
the children received a red balloon.
What would be the number of red hats
that would allow everyone to receive
a red balloon?

The answer is less than that number.
!******************************!
If all 10 children were wearing red caps,
then everyone would see at least four
and would get a red balloon. But no
child can see the cap on their own head.
With this in mind, ask yourself how many
children would receive a red balloon if
nine of them wore red hats. What about
if eight did? Seven?

Just keep going down the line, and
remember that at least four must be
wearing red caps.

Now for something on the flowery side.

Of the three pictures labelled A, B and C,
one is actually the same as the picture on
the far left. However, the image on the far
left has had its contents flipped left to
right and its colours inverted and changed
to black and white.

Of A, B and C, which picture is the same as
the black-and-white picture on the far left?
!******************************!
That's right!

Picture A is the same as the one on the
far left.

As shown above, pictures B and C have
slight variations.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think hard about the puzzle and try again.
!******************************!
The inverted colours of the altered
image makes this puzzle a lot more
challenging, doesn't it?

However, this change to the image may
end up helping you more than you think. 
Remember, in the altered image, dark
spots are now bright and vice versa.

!******************************!
Searching for differences between the
black-and-white image and each of the
three pictures A, B and C will
eventually lead you to the answer,
but there is an easier way.

Since one of the three is the same as
the black-and-white picture anyway,
why not start by finding how A, B and
C differ from one another?

Pay attention to the circles at the
centre of each flower. Also, take a good

<''>What are you playing at? Didn't you notice
that you took the #rlongest path possible

Knowing that the ant never travelled on the

the returning ant walked to get to her
nest?
!******************************!
That's right!

Perhaps all the heavy lifting kept this little
ant from thinking about her path home. If
only she'd thought about where she was
going, she could have saved herself a lot of
walking!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think hard about the puzzle and try again.

When tracing out a route back to the

<0019>The Train Journey

A number of people are on a train. At the
first station the train pulls into, 1/6 of
the people on board get off. At the next
station, 1/5 of the remaining passengers
get off. This pattern continues so that at
the next station 1/4 get off, then 1/3 and
then 1/2. Then, at the final station, all
remaining passengers get off the train.

Assuming no one got on the train during the
journey, what is the lowest number of
people who could have been on the train
when it set out?
!******************************!
Good work!

If you assume the train started out with
six passengers, then only one person
would have to get off at each station.

This puzzle can be really tough if you
don't remember to reduce the number of
people remaining on the train at each
station along the way.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think hard about the information you've
been given and try again. This puzzle comes
together quite easily once you realise a
certain simple principle.
!******************************!
Since the puzzle tells you that no one
got on the train during the journey,
it's safe to say that the number of
passengers on the train never
increased.
!******************************!
Since 1/6 of the passengers get off at
the first station, you know the number
must be divisible by six. Start by
choosing a number that's divisible by
six and see what happens.

The principle by which this puzzle
is solved should soon become evident.
!******************************!
Imagine that 30 passengers are on the
train when it departs. At the first
station, the train loses 1/6 of its
passengers, meaning five people get off.
At the next station, 1/5 of the
remaining 25, or five people, get off.
At the next station, 1/4 of the
remaining 20, which is to say five more
people, get off.

returns to his shop and gives the woman her
change. A while later, the shopkeeper from
next door storms into the shoe shop.
It turns out that the note he gave her was
a fake! The mortified shoe salesman gives
the shopkeeper <po>50 from the till to
apologise. Neither the customer nor the
shoes she took are found.

In total, how much did the shoe shop lose?

Well done!

The shoes the customer made off with
cost <po>30, and the change the salesman
gave her cost him another <po>20, bringing
his total losses to <po>50.

The salesman received <po>50 of real money
in exchange for the fake note from the

Two men, known here as 1 and 2, are playing
a strange game. First, both men put their
empty pitchers on the table. Next, a judge
brings a pitcher filled with vinegar and
places it in either spot A or spot B.
The judge then starts shifting the vinegar
from one pitcher to any adjacent pitcher
over and over. After moving the liquid 55
times, the owner of the vinegar-filled
pitcher must down it in one! Ugh!

If you were the judge and secretly wanted
2 to drink the vinegar, would you place the
pitcher down in spot A or B?
!******************************!
Nicely done!

The vinegar changes pitchers 55 times,
which is an odd number of pours. Regardless
of where you place your pitcher, whichever
pitcher sits in the middle of the three
will always contain the vinegar after an
odd number of pours.

Therefore, in order for man 2 to drink, the
vinegar-filled pitcher must go in spot B,
because doing so will put man 2's pitcher in
the middle, thus guaranteeing the vinegar
ends up in his pitcher.

Train stations are an especially good place
for dramatic farewells, aren't they?

Below is a painting of a man and woman
bidding each other a tearful goodbye.
Somewhere within this painting, however, is a
single unrealistic detail. 

Find and circle that detail.

Well spotted!

Were the man in the painting to open the
window as shown above, the frame would go

These days, most trains have windows that
only open partially. Of course, thanks to
modern air-conditioning, a good number of

<0028>The Warped Wheel

In the back of the train yard, there's an
old, warped wheel lying on the ground, as
shown below. While no longer functional, the
wheel is interesting because, when rolled on
a flat surface, its axle traces a funny
pattern if you look at it from the side.

Of the five diagrams below, which one
depicts the actual path of the axle?
!******************************!
That's right!

Diagram A correctly traces the path of the
axle as the wheel rolls.

You probably won't see this wheel on a train
anytime soon, but it would be fun to watch
it bounce around.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Try imagining how the wheel rotates again.

!******************************!
This wheel's shape is essentially a
triangle with the corners rounded off.
Since the axle is positioned close to
one of the corners, you can expect the
pattern it creates to be rather
unconventional.
!******************************!
The axle is positioned far from the
centre of the wheel, so you can expect
the path it traces to contain an
exaggerated up-and-down movement.

The answer isn't B or E. Choose from
the remaining three options and don't

Dropstone was founded 50 years ago, and
the founders commissioned a stone
sculpture to commemorate that day.
Unfortunately the dozy sculptor managed to
engrave the wrong date onto it. The whole
village had to live with the erroneous
sculpture until some bright spark realised
that converting it in a certain way would
enable the correct date to be displayed.
Think about what the sculpture could have
been converted into in order to display the
correct date.
On which date was Dropstone founded?
Answer in four digits (DD/MM).
!******************************!
Brilliant!

When converted into a fountain, water fills
the bowl, allowing the true date of
Dropstone's founding, 13-8, to be displayed.

The inattentive sculptor must have been
relieved at getting away with such sloppy
chiselling.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think hard about the puzzle and try again.

The puzzle text tells you that the
sculptor engraved the wrong date into
the stone, so you know that 12-8 isn't
the date Dropstone was founded.

Does the sculpture's shape give you a
clue into what it could have been
converted?

That big bowl and the opening at the

Johnny and Thomas are each carrying some
apples. If Johnny gave Thomas one apple, the
two men would each have the same number of
apples. Conversely, if Thomas gave Johnny
two apples, Johnny would have three times
the number of apples that Thomas has.

So, just how many apples are each of the
men holding?
!******************************!
Nice!

Johnny has seven apples and Thomas has
five.

As you can tell, if Johnny gave Thomas one
apple, both men would have six apples.
Additionally, if Thomas decided to give
Johnny two of his apples, Johnny would have
nine apples in total, three times as many
as Thomas.

Think hard about the puzzle and try again.
!******************************!
<''>If Johnny gave Thomas one apple, the

<''>If Thomas gave Johnny two apples,
Johnny would have three times the
number of apples that Thomas would

You know from Hint 1 that the gap
between Johnny and Thomas is two. In
the above scenario, the gap increases
by four, to six. We now know that
when Thomas loses two apples, Johnny
has six more than him, and also three
times more.

result of adding six and multiplying by
three is the same? That number is how

A large net has been cast out in a pond to
catch some fish. The pond's surface is small,
but it's actually wider underwater, so parts
of the sunken net are no longer visible
from the surface.

Assuming that there are no tears in the net
and that the whole rim of the net is
constructed of a single length of rope that
ends on the shore, how many of the fish
visible in the pond will be caught when the
net is pulled up?
!******************************!
That's right!

To solve this puzzle, you need to imagine
how the unseen parts of the net connect,
which should look something like the
illustration above.

As you can see, the net will catch a
total of seven fish.

A  pro golfer has the amazing ability to
consistently putt distances of 3, 5, 7 and
11 metres. Strangely enough, though, those
are the only distances he can putt.

Currently, our golfer stands on the green
with his ball 20 metres from the hole.
What's the fewest number of strokes he can
use to get the ball into the hole?

Assume that if the ball is hit farther than
the distance remaining to the hole, it will
roll over to the other side without going
into the cup. 
!******************************!
Good job!

If our friend the pro golfer putts two
diagonal shots as shown above, he can
sink the ball in two shots. No one ever
said the golfer had to putt directly
towards the hole, did they?

Sure, in order to sink the putt using
the method shown above, he'd need to
calculate the angle of each shot
perfectly, but that's probably why they
call him a pro!

Too bad!

Remember, this is a pro golfer we're talking

There's no reason our golfing friend
should have to hit each putt straight
towards the hole.

position with a shot that travels
diagonally.

Picture the golfer taking a diagonal
shot relative to the hole. If he hits the
ball exactly 11 metres and angles the
shot so that this first putt puts him
exactly halfway between his starting
position and the hole...

<0038>Four Horses

You have four horses, all of which travel at
different speeds. In travelling from point A
to point B, these horses take one, two, four
and six hours respectively.

One day, you decide to move all your horses
from point A to point B. However, you can
only move a maximum of two horses at a time,
and you need to ride a horse back to
point A each time you return to move your
other horses. Knowing you can only move as
fast as the slowest horse you're travelling
with, what's the fewest number of hours it
will take to move all the horses?
!******************************!
That's right!

To start, take your one- and two-hour
horses. Then ride your one-hour horse
back. Next, ride out on your four- and
six-hour horses, and return on your
two-hour horse. At this point you've been
moving horses for 11 hours - three in the
first excursion, and eight in the next.

Now you should be back at point A with your
one- and two-hour horses. Ride them both
across to point B to finish the task in 
13 hours.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think hard about what the puzzle is asking
you to do.
!******************************!
When crossing back over from B to A, you
want to move as quickly as possible, so
make sure you put yourself in a position
to cross over to A on the one-hour
horse when possible.

However, if you always make travelling
back on your one-hour horse your top
priority, you may end up wasting time on
other legs of the journey. Don't assume
you always need to return from B to A
on the one-hour horse.
!******************************!
In order to move all your horses from
A to B in the shortest amount of time,
you'll need to cross over from A to B
three times and return from B to A
twice.

How do you make the most effective use
of this limited number of crossings?
!******************************!
First, bring your one-hour and two-hour
horses over to B, then return to A on
your one-hour horse.

Next, bring your four- and six-hour
horses over to B and return to A on
your two-hour horse.

This method minimises the overall amount
of time necessary to move all your
horses to point B.

your remaining white items in the right

with a single red rope that has been tied
in a very loose knot. Can you work out
how many of the smaller loops of rope
would get caught in this knot when the
red rope is pulled tight from both ends?

Remember, even if a loop passes through
the knotted part of the red rope now,
it might fall away when the red rope
is tightened.
!******************************!
Good thinking!

Not a single loop will become truly entangled
in the knot that forms. When you pull the
red rope and form a knot, one loop will fall
away and the other two will hang from the
red rope, free of the knot.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Make sure you examine every detail of the
picture carefully!
!******************************!
Look carefully at the places where
different loops overlap the red rope.
Even if they appear to be wrapped
around each other, they may only be
piled on top of each other.

You've probably experienced this
phenomenon before when untangling
a mess of cables at home.

!******************************!
Pay special attention to the big loop
in the red rope, since this is the part
that will form a knot and and is the key
to solving this puzzle.

Try using the Memo Function to trace
which small loops of rope could become
caught in the knot in the red rope when
it is tightened.
!******************************!
Do you see the yellow loop of rope?
It may look tangled in with the others,
but it turns out that when the red rope
is pulled to make a tight knot, this loop
will slip free.

Now, is there anything different about
the other two smaller loops?

Three people at odds with one another are
running for mayor in the upcoming town
election. They are all locals of the town,
which has a voter population of 40.
In order to win, a candidate must get
more votes than any other candidate.

If each of the 40 voters casts a single
vote and every vote is recognised, what
is the fewest number of votes a candidate
needs to secure victory?
!******************************!
That's right!

The winner needs at least 20 votes.

Since each of the candidates dislikes the
other two, they will probably all vote for
themselves. 40 votes minus those three
votes leaves 37 votes. The winner will need
over half the votes, or 19. Add the winning
candidate's personal vote to that and you
get 20 votes. Even if another candidate
gathered all the remaining 18 votes, that
wouldn't be enough to overcome the
candidate with 20 votes. 
!******************************!
Too bad!

given and try again.
!******************************!
Think about how many votes will be cast
in the town excluding the three cast by
the candidates themselves.

The three candidates themselves also
have the right to vote.

Of course, since each of them wants to
win, you can take it for granted that
each candidate will vote for themselves.

40 votes minus the three votes cast
by the candidates leaves you with 37
votes.

Find the number of votes it takes to
gain a majority in a pool of 37 voters

Five cows are grazing at the festival. Two
of them are Troomoo cows, a breed that only
tells the truth. The other three are Nowhey
cows, a different variety that always lies.
Use the following statements from each cow
to work out which cows are liars.
Touch a letter to mark it with an X.

A: D is a Nowhey. I promise.
B: Oh no, C isn't a Troomoo cow.
C: A ain't a Nowhey cow. No way.
D: E's a Nowhey if I've ever seen one.
E: B's definitely not a Troomoo.
!******************************!
That's right!

Cows A, C and E are Nowheys. If you assume
each cow to be a Nowhey or a Troomoo and
run through each of the cows' statements,
you'll eventually realise that the only time
there can be three Nowheys is if they are
A, C and E.

through all the cows' statements to

Let's assume for a moment that cow A
is a Troomoo. If you assume this to be
true and go through the statements
for each cow, you should come to the
conclusion that you must have three
Troomoo cows and two Nowheys. Since
you know that there are two Troomoos
and three Nowheys, you know that this

If you can get the biggest pancake onto
the red plate, you're almost there.

You have three dyes.

No two adjacent sections of the flag can be
the same colour, each section can only be
one colour and you can't change the number
or size of these sections.

If you aren't allowed to mix the dyes, how
many distinct flag designs are possible? 

!******************************!

Once you incorporate the white colour of
the unpainted flag into your designs, you
actually have four colours you can work
with. If you assign a colour to the left
section of the flag and list all designs
possible, you get a total of nine variations.

Multiply this number by four, which
represents the number of colours at your
disposal, to get the answer: 36 variations.

colour of the flag's fabric is another
colour you can use in making your

make flag designs.

If the left section of your flag is red,

<''>The moon must be located two places
below the diamond.<''>

If the moon is two places below the

Draw your answer on the Touch Screen.
!******************************!
Nice!

If you draw a circle around the plaza about
one third of the way out from the middle,
your line will divide the doughnut shape
into two identically-shaped figures that are
directly proportional. In geometrical
terms, shapes like these are known as
similar figures.

Focus on the term <''>one line<''>.
There's a hint somewhere in there.
!******************************!
In the example illustration, the plaza has
been divided by two lines, which makes
the answer invalid.

The fact that you need to use a single
line to solve the puzzle is key. Since you
can only use one line, you know you won't
be solving this one by drawing lines
through the middle of the plaza.
!******************************!
Even if you avoid drawing your line
through the middle of the plaza, no
single straight line will divide the plaza
into two pieces that are the same shape.

By the way, did you notice that the goal
here isn't to make two pieces that are
the same size?
!******************************!
If you're still having trouble, you
should know that the single line you
need to draw is a circle.

The only remaining question is where to

That's right!

Moustachioed Mr O'Connor is sitting next to
his wife, so all the people on the left must
be sitting next to their spouses.
Mr Lambert is sitting opposite his wife, so
he must be sitting at the right-hand table.

The Joneses are sitting by the aisle, so
they must be c and g. That leaves e and
f as the Hadleys.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think hard about the clues you've been
given and try again.
!******************************!
The moustachioed Mr O'Connor is b.
Since both c and f are men, his wife has
to be a. 
!******************************!
The Joneses are both sitting by the
aisle, which means they must be sitting
opposite each other.

Since you know b is Mr O'Connor, c and g
must be Mr and Mrs Jones.
!******************************!
Where is Mr Lambert in all this?

We now know a and b to be the O'Connors,
so the people sitting opposite them must
also be a couple. But they can't be the
Lamberts because the Lamberts have to
be sitting opposite each other.

You should now be able to identify all
four couples.

<0008>Luke's Big Dinner
<00><19><16><13><11><0B><03><07><E9><03><02><FF>
<''>Luke, are you sure you can really eat all
that? You put in quite an order there.<''>

<''>No problem, Professor! I'll clean my plate
and still have room for more.<''>

It's no wonder the professor is concerned,
as Luke's order cost twice what his own did!

Below you can see all the items the two
ordered, along with their prices.

Touch the prices of the items that Luke
ordered.
!******************************!
Good work!

If you calculate the total bill, you'll see
that the meal cost <po>105. Knowing the total,
Luke must have ordered <po>70 worth of food
and the professor <po>35 worth. Once you've
got those numbers, the rest is easy.

<''>Are you sure you didn't order too much?<''>

<''>Nope! This (slurp) stew's great and the
steak is (chomp) delicious too!<''>

<''>...<''>
!******************************!
Too bad!

Perhaps you aren't going about this quite
the right way. Why don't you try a
different approach?
!******************************!
Start by adding up the cost of all the
items on the table.
!******************************!
Luke's meal cost twice as much as the
professor's. That means the ratio of
Luke's part of the bill compared to
the professor's must be 2:1.
!******************************!
The cost of the entire meal comes to
<po>105. This total needs to be split to fit
our ratio of 2:1. The sum of the parts of
this ratio is 3, so divide the total by 3
to get <po>35 and the costs come to
(2 x <po>35):(1 x <po>35). Therefore, Luke's
meal cost <po>70 and the professor's <po>35.

What combination of food and drink items
can you find that adds up to <po>70?

<0009>Stacked Glasses
<00><0A><08><06><12><0B><02><08><E8><03><02><FF>
The owner of a four-star restaurant
assigns a young waiter the task of stacking
glasses in a decorative way. Eager to
please, the waiter immediately draws five
separate designs and shows them to the
owner. The owner takes one glance at the
designs and, with a look of irritation, turns
to the boy and cries, <''>This design is
preposterous! What were you thinking?<''>.

Which of the five designs is the owner
talking about?
!******************************!
Exactly right!

The restaurant owner was talking about
sketch D. If you look closely, you can see
that the first and second row of glasses
couldn't possibly be arranged in the
manner depicted.

The simple 2D sketch didn't take into
account the rim of the glass.

!******************************!
Too bad!

Why do you suppose a simple drawing made
the restaurant owner so angry?
!******************************!
<''>This design is preposterous!<''>

The owner wasn't angry because the
design in question was hard to assemble.
He was upset because the design was
physically impossible to replicate in
real life.




!******************************!
A and C could probably be achieved with
steady hands and a lot of patience.

That leaves B, D and E.
!******************************!
There is one design that can be drawn
in 2D but, in reality, stacks the
glasses in an impossible way.

On paper, each cup is represented by a
single U-shaped line, but real glasses
have more to them than that, namely
sides and a rim on top.

<0010>A Work of Art
<01><0F><0D><0B><12><0B><16><09><F6><03><02><FF>
The drawing below is made up of curved lines
that intersect to create sections. If you
want to colour in the entire canvas so that
no section touches a section of the same
colour, what's the fewest number of colours
you can use?
You can use a colour as many times as you
like as long as it doesn't touch a section
with the same colour.

Once you have your answer, touch
#rInput Answer#x and enter the number of
colours. 

!******************************!
That's right!

You'll need three colours to fill in the
drawing. Most of the drawing can be done
with two colours, but one pesky area in
the bottom-left corner requires a third
colour to complete.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think about it and have another shot.
!******************************!
There's no trick here.

You might have an easier time if you
use the Memo Function to mark sections
of the drawing.
!******************************!
Why don't you take a closer look at
the corners of the drawing?
!******************************!
You can complete most of the drawing
using only two colours, but did you
notice there's one pesky area down in
the bottom-left corner that requires
an additional colour?
!******************************!
