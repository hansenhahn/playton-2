<0066>The Locked Box
<00><1E><1B><18><11><45><16><41><F6><03><04><FF>
The box shown below is fitted with a lock
consisting of two dials. You can't turn the
blue dial directly, but when you turn the red
dial, the blue dial moves an equal amount.
In order to see the relationship between
the two dials, you try turning the red one
from its original position, as shown below.
In order to open the lock, you must turn
the blue dial to 3, 6, 4 and 1 in that order.
Since you can't turn the blue dial directly,
to which numbers must you turn the red dial
in order to produce the desired numbers on
the blue dial?
!******************************!
That was tough!

The red dial needs to be turned to 2, 7,
1 and 4 to produce the numbers you need on
the blue dial.

It turns out these two dials actually rotate
in opposite directions. One way to solve
this problem is to create a chart with each
dial's corresponding numbers, like the one
shown above.
!******************************!
Too bad!

If you can just work out how the two dials
turn in relation to one another, the rest is
a breeze.
!******************************!
When the red dial reads 0, the blue dial 
reads 5. When the red dial reads 3, the
blue dial reads 2.

As stated in the puzzle, the distance
the blue dial moves is equal to the
distance the red dial moves. When the
red dial moves from 0 to 3, the blue dial
moves from 5 to 2. Read that last
sentence again and think about what it
says about the relationship between the
dials.
!******************************!
Did you catch on to what Hint 1 was
trying to tell you? The red and blue
dials turn the exact same amount but,
as you may have noticed, the numbers on
the dials move in opposite directions.
!******************************!
When you turn the red dial, the blue
dial moves the same amount in the
opposite direction.

All you need to do is construct a quick
table to show you how numbers on the
red dial correspond to other numbers on
the blue dial. Why not try using the
Memo Function to write the table?
