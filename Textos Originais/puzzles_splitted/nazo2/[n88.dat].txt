Here are four circular flower beds, each
with a radius of 10 metres. The way they're
arranged forms a space between them.
Can you find the area, in metres squared, of
the section coloured red below?

Ignore the width of the border around the
flower beds when calculating your answer.
!******************************!
Nice job!

The red section has an area of 400 square
metres. If you quarter the space between
the flower beds and fit the pieces to the
circle as shown on the diagram on the right,
you can turn the circle into a square.
Once you do, the sides of the square will
have the same length as the diameter of a
single flower bed: 20 metres. Square this
number to get the area and your answer.
!******************************!
Too bad!

You shouldn't need to do any complex maths
to solve this one.
!******************************!
Don't bother thinking about pi.
You don't need it to solve this one!
!******************************!
If you draw straight lines between the
four centre points of each of the
flower beds, it makes a square!
!******************************!
Draw a set of diagonal lines that go
from each point where two flower beds
touch, through the centre of the
diagram (the point at the exact
centre between all four flower beds).
This should divide that middle space
between all four flower beds into four
neat sections. What can you learn from
those four sections?
