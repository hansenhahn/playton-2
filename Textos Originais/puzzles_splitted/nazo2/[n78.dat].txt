<0079>The Gear Switch
<00><14><0A><05><11><46><02><4E><E8><03><04><FF>
The button that opens the door in front of
you is buried deep within this machine, so
you can't push it directly. However, by
pulling the lever at the top to the left or
right, you can move the various gears and
plates in the machine, allowing you to press
the button at the bottom.

In order to push the green button, should
you pull the lever towards A or B?
!******************************!
Nicely done!

Moving the lever towards B will spin the
gears in a way that causes the bottom lever
to hit the green button.

Since there are only two possible answers
for this puzzle, you could have just
guessed, but hopefully you were able to
work it out properly!
!******************************!
Too bad!

There are only two ways to answer this
question, so the answer must be the option
you didn't pick.

Before you answer, though, think the puzzle
through so you can understand the solution.
!******************************!
When one gear rotates with another, the
two gears must rotate in opposite
directions.

Use the Memo Function to keep track of
the direction of each gear's rotation.
!******************************!
The gear at the very bottom has to
rotate clockwise to hit the switch,
so the board of teeth directly above it
will need to move to the right.
Make sense? Now continue that line of
thought as you move up towards the
lever.
!******************************!
The board of teeth underneath the
three gears at the top needs to move to
the left. Therefore, the gear directly
above it needs to rotate clockwise.

Keep going until you reach the lever at
the top!
