<0104>Disappearing Act 4

You know the drill by now. You can move
any ball on the board below as long as it
satisfies the following conditions:
<->To move, jump your selected ball over an
adjacent space occupied by another ball
into an empty space on the other side.
You can't jump diagonally.
<->Once you've made the jump, the ball you
jumped over disappears from the board.
<->To complete the puzzle, you must remove all
balls from the board except for one.

OK, enough rules. Try it for yourself!
!******************************!
Nice!

The only condition for solving these puzzles
was eliminating all but one ball from the
board, but the true solution to these
puzzles requires you to finish with the ball
positioned in the centre space.

Perhaps that will provide some incentive
for you to revisit a few of these peg
solitaire puzzles.


!******************************!
Too bad!
!******************************!
These puzzles are a lot more fun if you
experiment and try to come to the
answer on your own. Don't depend on
Hints 2 and 3 to give away too much
of the puzzle.

Start this puzzle by moving the ball
in the centre of the second row from
the top.
!******************************!
No more hints to be had here! Instead,
here's a little fun fact. Did you know
that peg solitaire is actually known as
brainvita in India?

Oh, and just so you know, Hint 3 is
also trivia.
!******************************!
There are many games known as solitaire,
some using boards divided into spaces
and some using playing cards.
On a related note, a very large number
of computer games you could call
solitaire games have been made since
the early days of video games.
