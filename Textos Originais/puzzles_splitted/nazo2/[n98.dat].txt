<0099>Jars and Cans 2
<00><1E><1B><18><12><3A><1E><62><03><04><04><31>
Look at that, another row of jars and
cans all mixed up, and this time there are
even more of them. As before, your job is
to rearrange these items so that both jars
and cans are grouped with items of the
same type. However, in doing so, you
must always move two containers at once.

Move items around by touching the red icon
between two containers and dragging the
selected pair of items around with the
stylus.

Well done!

This puzzle is based on one widely known in
Japan since the Edo era.

Too bad!

This is another puzzle where the order
of your moves is key. You won't get any
hints on this one, but as a general tip
for this type of puzzle, you should take
care not to return items to their
original position while moving them
around. Also, you should know that
although there are a lot more jars and
cans this time, it shouldn't take any
more moves to solve than the last
puzzle.

In Japan the type of puzzle you are
playing now is known as a Mandarin duck
puzzle. Mandarin ducks are famous for
the affectionate way male and female
pairs of ducks get along. Some theorise
that the game is known by this name
because of the way Mandarin duck
couples tend to move about together.
!******************************!
Here's another piece of fun trivia
for you. As stated in Hint 2, these
puzzles are referred to as Mandarin
duck puzzles because of the
affectionate behaviour Mandarin duck
couples exhibit towards each other, but
it turns out that these birds change
mates every year!

This may not help you with the puzzle,
but isn't it interesting?
