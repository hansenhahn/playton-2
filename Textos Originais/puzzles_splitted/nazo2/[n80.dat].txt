<0081>The Old Safe
<00><32><2D><28><11><49><0A><50><53><04><04><FF>
Find the four-digit code that opens the
safe. You can use the digits 0 to 5 in your
answer, but each digit can only be used
once. The small lights next to each row of
digits are the key to finding the code, as
they tell you how much in common that row
has with the code. A white light indicates a
digit that is in the code but in a different
place in the sequence. An orange light
indicates a digit that is in the code and in
the correct spot. Touch the digits at the
bottom of the screen to change them, then
touch #rSubmit#x when you have your answer.
!******************************!
That's right!

The code is 0154. You could solve this by
entering numbers haphazardly until you
stumble upon the solution, but it's much
more fun to think your way to the answer.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Give the puzzle another try.
!******************************!
Start by working out which digits belong
in the code, regardless of order.
!******************************!
You may have already noticed, but every
digit in the code is in the very top row
of digits. Two of the digits in 4150 are
even in the right place.
!******************************!
Take a look at the third row of digits.

You can see that two digits match ones
in the code and are in the correct
position. Since you know the code uses
4, 1, 5 and 0, you can assume the 0
and 1 from this row are part of the
code and in the right place.

Now work out where 4 and 5 go.
