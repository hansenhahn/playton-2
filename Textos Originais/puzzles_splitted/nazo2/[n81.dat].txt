<0082>Restarting the Lift
<00><1E><1B><18><11><49><0F><51><F5><03><04><FF>
The wires connecting the lift to the button
controlling it have somehow been severed.
However, if you can connect the
negative (-) and positive (+) wires on the
top to the wires carrying the same charge
below, you can fix the lift. To do this,
draw lines between sets of terminals.
Draw two lines to connect each positive and
negative terminal to its counterpart and
get the lift running again.
!******************************!
We're back in business!

The lift is working again!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Did you make sure to connect the positive
wire (+) and negative wire (-) to wires
with the same charge?
!******************************!
You need to connect wires with the same
symbol together. So + goes with + and
- with another -.

If you examine the tangle of wires,
finding the solution should be simple
enough.
!******************************!
To make things simpler, identify the
wires that are connected to some other
area off the screen and eliminate them
as possible answers.

In the top row of wires, the rightmost
wire and the one third from the right
run off the screen.
!******************************!
The leftmost terminal in the top set
of four is connected to the wire
carrying a negative (-) current.

Now it's up to you to work out the other
three terminals you need to use.
