Here's a tasty puzzle for you.

Can you move the pile of pancakes from the
blue plate on the left to the red plate on
the right? Wait, though, it's not as easy as
it sounds. You must follow these rules:

<->You can only move one pancake at a time.
<->You cannot place a pancake on top of
another one that is smaller than itself.

You can use the middle plate and move
the pancakes as many times as you like.
!******************************!
Hot and fresh!

Now the only question is what to put on
them!
!******************************!
Too bad!
!******************************!
Having trouble? Just follow the hints
given to you in <''>Piles of Pancakes 2<''>.
This is the last hint you're going to get
for this puzzle, so it would be a
waste to spend another hint coin here.
All you'll get is trivia, so consider this
a warning!
!******************************!
Looks like you went and spent that hint
coin anyway. Must be nice having hint
coins to burn! OK then, here's a little
fun fact for you.

These pancake puzzles are based on a
puzzle called the Tower of Hanoi, which
can be solved using a basic concept
known in computer science as recursion.
That might not be much help to you right
now, but it is interesting stuff, isn't
it?
!******************************!
All right then, moneybags, time for
more fun facts.

Edouard Lucas, the man who thought up
the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, introduced
the puzzle saying that it was based on
an Indian myth that said the world would
be destroyed if anyone solved a special,
very large version of this puzzle.
Though that myth is quite fascinating,
many think that Lucas fabricated it
himself.
