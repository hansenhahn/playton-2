<0113>A Stack of Dice
<00><1E><1B><17><11><2D><16><70><F6><03><04><29>
You've stacked three dice in a column.
At the points where two dice touch, the
faces that are touching add up to five.

If one visible face of the bottom die is
showing a one, what number must be on the
top face of the top die?

Each die is identical and all sets of opposing
faces on each die add up to seven, just like
any other die.
!******************************!
That's right!

Since you know that the sum of each set of
opposing faces is seven, you can easily
narrow down the possibilities. With a
little smart thinking, as detailed above,
you'll soon arrive at the answer: six.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think hard about the puzzle and try again.
!******************************!
At the two points where two dice touch,
the sum of the two faces making contact
equals five. If that's so, then each of
these four faces must be a number
between one and four.
!******************************!
The options for the top face of the
bottom die are limited. That face can
only be a two, three or four.
!******************************!
Assume for a minute that the top face
of the bottom die is a four. If so,
then the bottom face of the middle die
must be a one, which would make the top
face of this second die a six. Since
you know that the four faces in contact
with each other must be between one and
four, you can rule out this possibility.
