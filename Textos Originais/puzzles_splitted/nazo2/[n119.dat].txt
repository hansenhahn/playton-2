<0119>The Fake Coins
<00><1E><1B><18><11><3B><16><77><F6><03><04><FF>
There are 10 coins in each of the five bags
below. One of these bags is filled with fake
coins that are lighter than the real ones.
A real coin weighs 10 grams, but a fake coin
is one gram lighter. If you're using a scale
that can register up to 200 grams, what is
the fewest number of times you could use
the scale to find the one bag filled with
fake coins?
!******************************!
You got it!

You only need to use the scale once.
From every bag, remove the number of coins
indicated by the bag's number. Then you
just weigh these 15 coins once.

If all of the coins were real, their combined
weight would be 150 grams, but you'll end up
with a weight less than this. The difference
between this actual weight and 150 grams
corresponds to the number on the bag of
fake coins.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Stick with it until you work it out!
!******************************!
The bag of fake coins contains only fake
coins, each of them one gram lighter
than a real coin. So, you could take one
coin out of each bag and weigh them each
in turn, using the scale five times. 

But that wouldn't make for a very
interesting puzzle, would it?
!******************************!
Think about how to accomplish your goal
in fewer than five weighings. If you
tried to weigh all the bags at once,
you would go over the scale's measuring
capacity.
!******************************!
Hint 2 had the idea of weighing all the
bags at once. There are 10 10-gram
coins in each of the five bags, for a
total of 500 grams. But one bag contains
fake coins, so the weight is actually
less than that.

Perhaps the key to solving this really
is to weigh all the bags at once, in a
sense?
