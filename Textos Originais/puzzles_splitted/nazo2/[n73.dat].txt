<0074>Sealing Off the Smell

Garlic is a wonderful seasoning when used
in moderation, but the smell can be pretty
potent. Someone put garlic cloves in this
intricate container and they're really
stinking up the room. Use the two corks
below to help our friend deal with the
smell.

Touch the screen in the place you want to
put the corks. Your answer must use no
more than two corks.
!******************************!
Ah, sweet relief!

Each of the three holes in the container is
connected to the garlic, so there's no real
way to seal off the container using two
corks. With no way to contain the smell, our
friend had no choice but to plug up his
nostrils.

Hopefully he had the good sense to stay
inside where no one could see him like that!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Those corks aren't doing the trick in their
current locations.
!******************************!
The most logical thing to do at first is
to use the Memo Function to trace which
openings in the container lead to the
garlic cloves.
!******************************!
Hmm? Something seems strange, you say?

Why yes, the fact that all three
openings in the container connect to
the garlic is a bit strange...

How to contain the smell then?
!******************************!
Since you're only allowed to use
two corks, you can't block all three
openings in the container.

You'll just have to look for another
set of openings that can be sealed
off using only two corks.
