<0095>Box of Books
<00><1E><1B><18><11><37><16><5E><F6><03><04><FF>
The box shown below has a height, width and
depth of 30cm. You'd like to place as many
books as possible in the box. Each book is
20cm wide by 20cm long by 10cm thick. How
many books can you pack into this box?

Books can only be placed in the box when
they are closed, but you can position each
book however you like inside the box.
!******************************!
Very nice!

If you arrange the books in the box in the
method shown, you can cram a whopping six
books into it!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think in three dimensions to find the
solution. 
!******************************!
If all you had to do to solve this puzzle
was count how many books you can stack
in the box before it fills up, it wouldn't
be much fun.

You'll need to think creatively and in
three dimensions to solve this one.
!******************************!
The bottom of the box measures 30cm
by 30 cm. Each book is 20 cm by 20 cm,
so there is only space for one book
at the bottom of the box.
But if you do that, you'll be left with
10 cm spare on both sides. Say, isn't
that the exact same size as the
thickness of one book? 
!******************************!
Even if you place three books upright
in the box and use two more to fill what
gaps you can, you'll still have a good
chunk of wasted space on your hands.
Fitting the books together in a
space-efficient way is of utmost
importance in solving this puzzle.
