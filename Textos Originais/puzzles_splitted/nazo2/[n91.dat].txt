Lucky you! You've inherited a five-square
plot of land that's rich in precious metals.
Each chunk of copper ore has a value of
one, each silver chunk has a value of three
and each gold chunk has a whopping value of
five. You're allowed to pick five squares
of land for yourself, but the five squares
must be connected to each other. Squares
diagonal to one another don't count as
connected.

Your task is to claim the most valuable
five-square plot possible. Can you do it?
!******************************!
You're rich!

The plot of land displayed is the only one
that acheives a value of 10, the highest
value possible given the conditions of the
puzzle.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Nope, that's not it.
!******************************!
Gold ore is worth a whopping five times
more than copper, so focus on claiming
some of that.

Wouldn't it be great if you could find
a five-square plot of land with two
pieces of gold ore on it? Sadly, that
doesn't seem likely.
!******************************!
Unfortunately, no single five-square
plot of land contains two pieces of
gold ore.

Now, it should be easy to find a plot
that has two pieces of silver ore on
it, but remember, your first priority
is choosing the plot with the highest
total value.
!******************************!
Copper is worth one, silver is worth
three and gold is worth five. Given
these values, you should be able to find
a single plot of land worth 10. Find
this plot and you've found your answer.
