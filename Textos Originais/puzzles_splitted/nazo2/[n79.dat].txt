The circuit board for the lift contains a
puzzle. According to the instructions, you
need to make the blue and red balls switch
places in order to restore power to the
lift. Are you up to the task?
!******************************!
Good job!

So, how many moves did it take you to
complete the task? If you did it in 12
moves, give yourself a pat on the back!

Oh... Listen! Do you hear that? It sounds
like the lift is up and running again.
!******************************!
Too bad!
!******************************!
There are several ways you could go
about solving this puzzle. One sure-fire
technique is to work with those
L-shaped blocks. You can free up some
extra room by moving these blocks so
that they fit together neatly with
neighbouring blocks.

!******************************!
In order to get both of those balls to
swap places, you first need to move one
ball out of its hole and park it
somewhere while you move the other one.
To do so, clear out some space by
gathering all those L-shaped blocks
on either the left or right side of
the box.
!******************************!
If the method from Hint 2 isn't working
for you, here's another technique you
can try. Create space by slotting
L-shaped blocks together to create
rectangles. In order to do this your goal
should be to move the L-shaped blocks
to the opposite edges of the box before
combining them.
