<0065>The Ancient Map
<00><19><16><13><11><28><05><40><EB><03><04><FF>
An ancient map depicts the possible spots
of a vast fortune along with these
directions:
<''>Inscribe the numbers 1 to 6 in the map's
blank spaces so that each set of numbers
in a straight line has the same sum.
This sum must be the largest one possible
given the condition described above. Then
grab your shovel and race to the spot
marked 1, for it is there that your
treasure resides!<''>
The number 4 has been filled in for you.
Circle the spot where the treasure is hidden.
!******************************!
You did it!

The treasure is buried in roughly the
centre of the map.

The sum you needed to work with was 10.
You could organise the numbers so that
each line added up to a total of nine, but
that is not the highest possible sum.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Are you certain each line of numbers adds
up to the same total?

Oh, and what about the sum of each line?
Is it the largest number possible given the
conditions?
!******************************!
The number 4 is already in place, so your
task is to decide where the numbers 1,
2, 3, 5 and 6 go.

Remember, your goal is to make every set
of numbers in a straight line add up to
the same total. Pay special attention to
the two lines that use the number 4, as
they are crucial to solving the puzzle.
 
!******************************!
Focus your attention on the spot on the
far right and how it forms a line with
the number 4.

Were you to insert a smaller number like
1 or 2 here, your total for the whole
line couldn't be any larger than 6.
With a total like that, there'd be no
place for you to put the number 6,
making the puzzle unsolvable. So, what
should go in that far right spot?
!******************************!
When arranged properly, each line of
numbers can add up to either 9 or 10.
The puzzle asked you to use the largest
sum possible, so you know you should
be aiming to make each line add up
to 10.
