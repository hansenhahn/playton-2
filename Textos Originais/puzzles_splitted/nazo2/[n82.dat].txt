<0083>Piles of Pancakes 2
<00><1E><1B><18><01><2E><0D><05><F3><03><04><30>
Here's a tasty puzzle for you.

Can you move the pile of pancakes from the
blue plate on the left to the red plate on
the right? Wait, though, it's not as easy as
it sounds. You must follow these rules:

<->You can only move one pancake at a time.
<->You cannot place a pancake on top of
another one that is smaller than itself.

You can use the middle plate and move
the pancakes as many times as you like.

Yummy!

Oh, and an extra pancake for those who
solved this puzzle in only 15 moves!

Too bad!

While you might have been able to solve
the first <''>Piles of Pancakes<''> puzzle by
just moving the pancakes around
randomly, you'll need to think harder
if you wish to find a solution this
time around.

See if you can come up with a rule for
effectively moving pancakes around. 
 
!******************************!
Developing an effective way of moving
the smallest pancake is key because
you can't place anything on top of it.
Think about a series of moves you can
repeat to keep that little pancake out
of your way.
!******************************!
Move the smallest pancake to the middle
plate and place the second-smallest
pancake on the red plate.
Next, move the smallest pancake on top
of the pancake on the right, and bring
a new pancake over to fill the middle
plate. After that, take the smallest
pancake and move it to the left plate.

Repeat this pattern, and as you move
the other pancakes around you'll solve
the problem in no time flat.
