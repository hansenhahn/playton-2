<0105>Disappearing Act 5
<00><3C><36><30><01><44><1D><8A><02><04><04><FF>
Get ready, because this one's going to be
rough. Just like before, you can move
any ball on the board below as long as it
satisfies the following conditions:
<->To move, jump your selected ball over an
adjacent space occupied by another ball
into an empty space on the other side.
You can't jump diagonally.
<->Once you've made the jump, the ball you
jumped over disappears from the board.
<->To complete the puzzle, you must remove all
balls from the board except for one.

OK, enough rules. Try it for yourself!
!******************************!
Nicely done!

One variation of this puzzle challenges the
player to complete the puzzle in the fewest
number of moves possible.

For the purposes of this puzzle, multiple
consecutive jumps using a single ball count
as only one move. If you've got some time on
your hands, why not try this puzzle again
and see how few moves you need to
complete it?
!******************************!
Too bad!
!******************************!
Surely it's more fun to think this one
through on your own...

...OK, fine, you can have a hint, but
just one. Do not start off this puzzle
by moving a ball into the centre space.
Instead, your first goal should be to
move things so you get rid of one of
those four balls at the very edge of
the shape. But where to start?
!******************************!
OK, OK, you can have another hint.

Start by moving one of the balls three
spaces in on the third row up. Move this
ball down to clear one ball and then
across to remove the ball at the bottom
of the shape. Then move a ball in the
third row up in the same direction as
your last move. Next, move the ball you
used from move one into the spot that
just opened up.
!******************************!
If you follow Hint 2 and continue
playing a little yourself, you should
be able to arrange the remaining balls
into a shape that's almost the same as
the pine tree you saw in <''>Disappearing
Act 3<''>. Use what you've learned to finish
the rest of this puzzle.
