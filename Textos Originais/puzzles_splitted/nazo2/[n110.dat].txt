<0111>How Many Turns?
<00><32><2D><28><11><25><03><6E><E9><03><04><3F>
Chelmey sent his squad out to investigate
an incident. Before leaving, he said this:
<''>I want you to search the entire area shown
on this map. Take any route you want, but
report how many times you turned in the
process. You're free to turn left or right,
but U-turns are strictly forbidden!<''>

The bobbies completed their shift and
returned to report their turns. Judging by
their reports, though, it seems at least
one man was loafing on the job. Touch the
numbers you think are suspicious to mark
them with an X.
!******************************!
Sharp thinking!

The two men who took 105 and 113 turns
must have been slacking off. Since the men
started out on a horizontal path, you can
infer that if they turned an odd number of
times, they'd end up on a vertical path.
Conversely, if they made an even number of
turns, they'd end up on a horizontal road.

Any bobby who did his job properly would
have to turn an even number of times to
get back to the station, which is at the
end of a horizontal road.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think hard about the puzzle and try again.
!******************************!
If one of the policemen had said he
turned a total of 1,000 times during the
course of his investigation, the
inspector would have no reason to doubt
the bobby was telling the truth.
!******************************!
With U-turns forbidden, there's a
certain logic you should be able to
find in all this confusion.
!******************************!
Leaving the station and turning an
odd number of times, regardless of
the number, will land you on a vertical
street. Conversely, turn an even number
of times after leaving the station and
you'll end up on a road that runs
horizontally across the screen.
