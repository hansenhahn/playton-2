Since Felix has requested that you hand
over a hat, can you find another hat
buried in the pattern below? The hat
you're looking for will be the same shape
and size as the black one shown below,
but may not be facing the same direction
as the example hat.

Use the stylus to outline your answer and

Sneaky!

Good job spotting that hidden hat! Now the
professor has a hat to give to Felix!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Look for an outline that exactly matches
the hat shown above the pattern.

The criss-crossing pattern is complicated,
and it can be hard to pick out what you're
looking for but, rest assured, it's there.
!******************************!
The shape is identical to the example
hat, so while you may find some shapes
that resemble the hat in question,
outlining one of these won't count as
a valid solution.

Study the points where the lines of
several shapes cross each other to
find the exact match to the example hat.
!******************************!
The hat hidden in the pattern has been
turned on its side.

Focus your search on the bottom-left
section of the picture.
