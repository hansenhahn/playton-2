<0101>Disappearing Act 1
<00><1E><1B><18><01><29><1D><8A><02><04><04><FF>
Here's a classic puzzle. The rules are
simple. You can move any ball on the
board below as long as it satisfies the
following conditions:
<->To move, jump your selected ball over an
adjacent space occupied by another ball
into an empty space on the other side.
You can't jump diagonally.
<->Once you've made the jump, the ball you
jumped over disappears from the board.
<->To complete the puzzle, you must remove all
balls from the board except for one.

OK, enough rules. Try it for yourself!

Well done!

This is one configuration of a puzzle known
as peg solitaire. As the name suggests, the
traditional version of this game is played
with pegs that you insert into holes in the
game board.

Too bad!
!******************************!
To make the first of the balls disappear,
jump the ball in the centre of the
cross over the ball to its immediate left
or right.
!******************************!
Move the ball at the very bottom into
the space formerly occupied by the
centre ball.

With just a few balls to go now, you
should be able to sail through the rest
of this puzzle.

With puzzles of this type, your first
move will often determine whether or
not you'll be able to solve the puzzle.
