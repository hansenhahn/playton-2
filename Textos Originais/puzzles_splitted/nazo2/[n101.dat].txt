<0102>Disappearing Act 2
<00><23><1F><1B><01><2D><1D><8A><02><04><04><2D>
Here's a different configuration for you
to try. As with last time, you can move
any ball on the board below as long as it
satisfies the following conditions:
<->To move, jump your selected ball over an
adjacent space occupied by another ball
into an empty space on the other side.
You can't jump diagonally.
<->Once you've made the jump, the ball you
jumped over disappears from the board.
<->To complete the puzzle, you must remove all
balls from the board except for one.

OK, enough rules. Try it for yourself!
!******************************!
You got it!

Peg solitaire is a puzzle with a long history.
It's thought to have first come into
popularity around the 17th century.
!******************************!
Too bad!
!******************************!
Your options for a first jump are fairly
limited. It has to be one of the four
balls surrounding the centre ball. The
tough part is deciding what to do next.

For your second move, pop a ball into
the space that opened up when you
moved the first one.
!******************************!
Next, move a ball into the open centre
space.
!******************************!
Read carefully, because this next move
is key.

You need to take the ball now sitting 
in the centre space and move it in the
direction that you moved your ball in
the first move.

The rest of the puzzle is up to you.
