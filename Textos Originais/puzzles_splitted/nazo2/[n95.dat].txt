Yikes! There's a ghost in the forest!

...Or so you thought, until you realised that
the spectre hovering in front of you was
just a figure cut out of wood hanging from
a branch. Looking around the area, you
notice four pieces of wood scattered in the
grass. From which one of these wooden
planks was the ghost cut out?

You have four choices: A, B, C or D.
Beware! The correct board may have flipped
over in the grass.

!******************************!
Good eye!

The ghost was cut from board B. The board
must have flipped over as it fell to the
ground. All the other boards have slight
differences that set them apart from the
correct one.
!******************************!
Too bad!

All the boards might look the same at first,
but if you look carefully, you'll start to
see the differences.

Don't forget to consider the outline each
board makes when flipped over, too.
!******************************!
Think you've found the answer? You're
sure? Well, just to be safe, compare its
outline to the ghost one more time. Don't
forget to look at little details, like the
shape of its hands.
!******************************!
You should pay extra attention to the
length of the ghost's tail.
!******************************!
Take note of which way the ghost's
arms should be facing!

Oh, and just so you know, the board
you're looking for needs to be flipped
over to match the outline of the ghost.
