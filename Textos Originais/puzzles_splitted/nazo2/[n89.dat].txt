<0090>The Unusual Fountain
<00><14><12><10><11><34><05><59><EB><03><04><FF>
The fountain shown below has the unusual
ability to indicate the age of those who
approach it.

For example, if a five-year-old child were
to approach, the fountain would fire off
water from spouts A, B, C, D and E in that
order. For age 15, the middle spout would
fire, followed by spouts A to E. For
someone aged 30, the middle spout would
fire off three times. Given the fountain's
method of indicating age, there's one
utterly useless spout on the fountain.
Find and circle this spout.
!******************************!
Good catch!

The spout marked J is basically useless.
A to I represent a unit of one year each,
displaying numbers from 1-9, and the middle
spout represents a unit of 10 years, spout
J will never be used. 
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think about the fountain's method of
indicating age.
!******************************!
The puzzle asks for you to find a spout
that's utterly useless, meaning the 
spout never gets used. Which one could
that be?
!******************************!
Read over the conditions that cause
each spout to spray water, then try
applying that knowledge. For example,
think about how the fountain would
indicate the ages from 10 to 20.
!******************************!
Spout A fires off to indicate one year,
A and B fire for two, A, B and C for
three, A, B, C and D for four and so on.

So, if spouts A-I all firing off one
after another are meant to indicate
nine, then...
