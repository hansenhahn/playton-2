<0076>Top of the Tower
<00><14><12><10><12><3C><05><4B><EB><03><04><FF>
In one quiet town there's a tower that
commands a view of the whole town.

Since you can see every building in town
from the tower, logic dictates that you
should be able to see the top of the tower
from any building in town. As you can see
on the map shown below, however, there's
one building in town from which you clearly
have no chance of seeing the top of the
tower, no matter which window you look out
of.

Can you find this building?
!******************************!
Good thinking!

From inside the tower, there's no way to
see the top of it. You may be able to stick
your neck out of a window and look up, but
you still won't be able to see the top of it.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Don't forget, you're looking for a building
where the view of the top of the tower is
blocked.
!******************************!
Looking for some buildings that block
each other's view?

Hmm, it doesn't look like there are any
buildings like that around town.
!******************************!
You need to find a building from which
the top of the tower can't be seen.

To put it another way, you're looking
for a buiding that doesn't allow you to
see the outside of the tower.
!******************************!
There's one building from which you
definitely won't be able to see
the outside of the tower.
