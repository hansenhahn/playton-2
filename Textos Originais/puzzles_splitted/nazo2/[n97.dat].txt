A long line of jars and cans sits on the
counter. Your job is to rearrange these
items so that both jars and cans are
grouped with items of the same type.
However, in doing so, you must always
move two containers at once.

Move items around by touching the red icon
between two containers and dragging the
selected pair of items around with the
stylus.
!******************************!
Well done!

Now the jars and cans are sorted neatly.
If only people would organise things
properly in the first place...

Too bad!

This puzzle is all about finding the right
order in which to make your moves.
The more organised players out there
should be able to solve this one on
instinct alone.

Since it's a relatively simple puzzle,
don't expect to find any more hints.
Instead, you'll get some trivia about
this type of puzzle. If you're short
on hint coins, stay away from the
last two hints!
!******************************!
This is another one of those puzzles
that's been around practically forever.
Variations of it exist across the globe
and have even been said to be played in
places like Edo-era Japan.
!******************************!
In Japan, this puzzle is often presented
using pieces from Go, a strategic
board game originally from China. In
England, the puzzle was often set up
using silver and gold coins.
