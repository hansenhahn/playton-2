<0078>A Maze of Doors
<00><19><14><0F><12><47><05><4D><EB><03><04><45>
All the doors in the maze below only open
when pushed from one direction, as shown.

It is therefore impossible to pass through
every room while going through the maze
from the entrance to the exit. However,
this feat would be possible if one of the
doors could open in the opposite direction.
Can you find and circle this door?
!******************************!
You did it!

You have to pass through every room on the
way to the exit to solve the puzzle, but no
one ever said you can't pass through the
same room twice.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Use the Memo Function to draw your
proposed route while you think about the
problem.
!******************************!
Let's review this puzzle's conditions.
You need to make one door open in the
opposite direction and you must pass
through every room on your way to the
exit.

But no one ever said you could only pass
through each room once.

!******************************!
Starting from the entrance, you'll soon
bump into a door that should open the
opposite way. So, to proceed, one of the
first doors you meet will have to open
in the opposite direction.

The upper door in the first room and
the two doors in the room to the
immediate right of the first room open in
a direction that keeps you from passing
through. One of these three doors is
the door you'll need to change.
!******************************!
The upper door in the first room is
fine the way it is.
