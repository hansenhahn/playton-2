<0112>Turn on the Light
<00><28><24><20><11><33><0F><6F><F5><03><04><FF>
The board shown in the picture on the left
is wired on the underside so that holding
contact points A and B together turns the
light on.

Now look at the board in the centre. This
light has three contact points: A, B and C.
No matter whether you hold contact points
A and B, B and C or A and C together, the
light stays on. In that case, how must the
wires be connected on the underside of the
board? Draw the solution that requires the
fewest number of connections. The dotted
red line indicates a known wire.
!******************************!
Bright idea!

All you really have to do is connect
that light bulb to the battery.
The puzzle tells you that the light
stays lit no matter which combination
of contact points are held together.
Naturally, the light will also stay lit
when none of those connections are made.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Are you sure your solution meets all the
conditions set out by the puzzle?

This might make you think that the
electricity has to run through all three
of these connections, but at the same
time, the positive and negative signals
need to be isolated from each other,
which makes things more difficult.
Read the conditions you have to meet 
again as carefully as you can.
!******************************!
You might be tempted to construct
something resembling a proper wiring
job, but that won't do the trick here.
Be flexible in your thinking about
what will get the job done!
!******************************!
You only need to draw one wire!
