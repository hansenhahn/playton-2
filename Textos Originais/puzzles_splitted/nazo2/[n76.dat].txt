<0077>Balancing Ornaments
<00><1E><14><0A><11><46><1A><4C><00><04><04><46>
Small ornaments dangle from a metal bar, and
they've thrown the bar off balance.

The five ornament strings are spaced
equally apart and each type of ornament
weighs a different amount. Three light
ornaments weigh the same as one heavy
ornament, while two light ornaments weigh
the same as a medium ornament.

Place one of the three ornaments in the
rectangle into the space marked <''>?<''> to
restore the bar's balance.
!******************************!
Good job!

The crescent moon ornament is just heavy
enough to balance things out. A single
star ornament weighs the same as one sun
and one moon together. The strand of
ornaments that is supposed to
counterbalance the one with a <''>?<''> doesn't
have any star-shaped ornaments, but if you
compare the ornaments as shown above you
can work out what should go in the <''>?<''>
space regardless.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Concentrate on working out which of the
three ornaments must be the heaviest.
!******************************!
The middle strand of ornaments doesn't
affect the balance of the bar, so ignore
it.

Also, the two strands hanging at the
ends of the bar are the same weight, so
try comparing the ornaments on the far
left to the ornaments on the far right.
You might find out something new.
!******************************!
Look at the strands on the far left and
the far right. While they both contain
sun and moon ornaments, only the far
right strand has a star.
By comparing the ornaments on these
two strands, you can probably work
out how many suns and moons it takes
to equal the weight of a star.
!******************************!
A single star weighs the same as one
sun and one moon.

Now that you know the weight of one
star, you should now be able to compare
the two strands next to the middle
strand.
