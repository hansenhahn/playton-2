<0072>Scrambled Photos
<00><23><1F><1B><12><2B><10><47><F6><03><04><09>
Four photographs decorate the wall of
Joseph's photo studio. Each photo depicts
the same area and was taken at the exact
same time of day. However, each photo was
taken at a different point in time, and if
you look carefully, you can work out the
order in which these pictures were taken.
Enter your answer using the letters
attached to each picture, starting with
the earliest, like so: ABCD.
!******************************!
Good eye!

The correct order is CDBA.

In C, the street light has yet to be
installed, but in D, the light has been built.
In B, there's a new building in the
background and the restaurant's window is
broken. Finally, in A, the broken window seen
in B has been patched up and some of the
lights in the restaurant's sign have burned
out. What's more, the door of the photo
studio has been painted a different colour.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Examine the four pictures again in case you
missed a crucial detail.
!******************************!
Start by scanning all four pictures
for differences between them.

For example, maybe the buildings are
different in one or two of the photos...
!******************************!
Photo C is the only one where the stairs
aren't illuminated, because there's no
visible street light.

Photos C and D are both missing that big
orange building in the background. By
contrast, the building and street light
are visible in photos A and B.
!******************************!
The door to the photo studio is the same
colour in all pictures except for A.
Also, in B, one of the restaurant
windows is broken. However, the window
is patched up in A, so A must have
been taken after B.
