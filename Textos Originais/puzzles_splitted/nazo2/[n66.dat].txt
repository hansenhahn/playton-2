<0067>Sammy's Working Week
<00><28><24><20><51><24><16><42><F6><03><04><FF>
<''>So, let's say today is my day off. If
yesterday wasn't also a day off, then I'm
off again tomorrow. If, on the other hand,
I was off yesterday, then tomorrow I'll
have to work. Now, let's say I worked today.
What a drag. If I didn't work two days
before today, I'll have to head to work
tomorrow. But if I did work two days ago,
I'm off tomorrow. Yeow!<''>

Assuming a standard 365-day year and
ignoring weekdays and holidays, use what
Sammy told you to work out the number of
days he works in a year.
!******************************!
Score!

Sammy's lengthy and convoluted explanation
may have been hard to understand, but his
work schedule is simple. He works three
days in a row, rests for two, and then
repeats the pattern. Put a different way,
Sammy works three out of every five days.
3/5ths of a 365-day year gives you 219
work days per year.

That's a pretty sweet deal he's got
going on.
!******************************!
Too bad!

See if you can't organise Sammy's rambling
description into something a little easier
to understand.
!******************************!
Sammy's work and rest schedule repeats
itself every five days.
!******************************!
Sammy's schedule is a cycle that
consists of three days on the job
followed by two days off.
!******************************!
Sammy works 3/5 of the days in the
year. With that fact under your belt,
you should be able to find the answer
using a simple calculation.
