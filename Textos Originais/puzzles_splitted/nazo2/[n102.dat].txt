<0103>Disappearing Act 3

Hmm, these are getting pretty tough.
You can move any ball on the board below
as long as it satisfies the following
conditions:
<->To move, jump your selected ball over an
adjacent space occupied by another ball
into an empty space on the other side.
You can't jump diagonally.
<->Once you've made the jump, the ball you
jumped over disappears from the board.
<->To complete the puzzle, you must remove all
balls from the board except for one.

OK, enough rules. Try it for yourself!
!******************************!
Good job!

This game is often played on two different
types of boards: English and French. The
puzzle you just played used an
English-style board.
!******************************!
Too bad!
!******************************!
Wow, these puzzles are really getting
tough. Here's a hint to take the edge
off this puzzle.

Start by clearing the ball that's third
from the edge, sitting in the bottom row.
!******************************!
Next, move the ball on the edge of
the bottom row to fill the space that
opened up when you removed the ball
in your first move. Then, repeat the
process detailed in Hints 1 and 2
on the other side of the triangle and
move the balls around until you're left
with a number of balls arranged in a
shape that resembles a pine tree.
The rest of this puzzle is up to you.
!******************************!
Hey, didn't Hint 2 clearly say, <''>the rest
is up to you<''>? Well, just know that you
won't be able to rely on too many hints
in the <''>Disappearing Act<''> puzzles to
come! You can have a hint this time,
though.

Select a ball one in from the outer
edge of the pine tree and jump it
upwards. Then, from this new location,
jump over the tip of the tree. OK, this
time, the rest really is up to you.
