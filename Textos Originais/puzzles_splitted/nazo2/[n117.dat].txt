<0117>Three Couples
<00><1E><14><0A><11><40><02><75><E8><03><04><FF>
A yellowed photograph shows three couples.
In the photo, no one man is standing
directly above his spouse. Of the three
women present, two are sisters and are
sitting next to each other. The elder
sister's husband is the man without a
moustache. Everyone in the picture is
wearing a hat, except the husband of the
younger sister. The woman unrelated to the
other two is sitting in front of the younger
sister's husband.
So, can you find the man in this lot who
is married to neither sister?
Choose from A, B or C.
!******************************!
Great job!

The answer is B. Finding the answer to this
one just requires close reading.

You know the elder sister's husband has
no moustache, so he must be A. You also
know that the younger sister's husband has
no hat, so he's obviously C. With those two
choices eliminated, the answer is clear.

Oh, and in case you're wondering, the
elder sister is E, the little sister is D
and the last woman, F, is married to B.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Make sure you read the clues correctly!
!******************************!
There's no need to decipher the
relationships of every person in the
picture. Just focus on finding the
answer to the question at hand.
!******************************!
Who's married to the eldest sister?
Using the clues you've been given,
you should be able to find the answer
to that question almost immediately.
!******************************!
While we're on the subject, finding the
husband of the younger sister should be
a breeze as well.

With those two men identified, this
puzzle is as good as solved.
