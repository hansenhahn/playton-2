<0109>Walking the Dog
<00><32><2D><28><11><40><16><6C><F6><03><04><1B>
A young girl takes her dog out for a walk
with her dad. The girl starts walking with
the dog on a leash 10 seconds before the
dad starts. The second the dad steps out,
the girl takes the dog off the leash and
the dog runs over to the dad. Upon reaching
him, the dog turns around and heads for the
girl. The dog keeps doing this until the dad
catches up with the girl. If the dog moves
at five metres per second, the father at
two metres per second and the daughter at
one metre per second, how far does the dog
run by the time the dad catches up to his
daughter?
!******************************!
Perfect!

The dog will have run 50 metres in total.

The dog runs for the entire time it takes
for the father to catch up with his
daughter. Since the daughter has a 10
metre head start and her dad gains on her
at a rate of one metre per second, he'll
catch up in 10 seconds. The dog is running
at a rate of five metres per second, so
the answer must be 50 metres.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Are you sure you aren't overthinking this
one?
!******************************!
Puzzles with long explanations often
have traps hidden in their phrasing.
Try not to get caught out.

The dad moves at two metres per second
and the daughter moves at one metre
per second, so for every second that
passes, the distance between the two
shrinks by one metre.
!******************************!
The father sets out 10 seconds after
his daughter. The daughter walks at a
rate of one metre per second, so she's
already 10 metres ahead of her father
when he starts walking.

Using what you know from this hint and
the last one, you should be able to
work out that the father catches up to
his daughter in 10 seconds.
!******************************!
The dog runs at a rate of five metres
per second.

The father catches up to his daughter
in exactly 10 seconds.
