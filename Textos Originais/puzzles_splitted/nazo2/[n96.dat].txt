It's said that ancient peoples came up with
constellations by staring up at the stars
in the night sky. Here's a star-laden puzzle
to celebrate their achievements.

Below is a 6 x 6 grid of sky and stars
arranged into nine larger blocks. Arrange
these nine blocks so that each row and
column contains three stars. Blocks without
surrounding outlines can't be moved.
!******************************!
Brilliant!

The constellation is a bit...abstract, but
oh well.
!******************************!
Too bad!

There's at least one row or column in your
solution that doesn't have three stars.
!******************************!
You need to find a foothold to get
started, and the stars that are locked
in place should do nicely. Remember, if
two stars are locked into a row, you can
only place one more there.
!******************************!
The topmost row of blocks has two
blocks that are locked into place. Within
this row of blocks are two rows of
stars. The top row has two stars locked
in place and the bottom row has one.
Therefore, the one block you can place
in this row must have one star in its top
row and two in its bottom row.
!******************************!
Let's take a look at the leftmost
column of blocks, which also has two
blocks locked in place.
The left column of stars contained
here has only one star locked in place,
as does the right column. So, the block
that goes here must have two stars in
both its left and right rows.
