<0064>Stones in a Vase
<00><14><12><10><11><28><16><3F><F6><03><04><FF>
<''>This vase holds 101 stones, each identical
in size and feel. There are 50 black stones
and 51 white stones. Now, put on this
blindfold, reach in, and pull out as many
stones as you like. When you're finished, if
you've removed an equal number of black and
white stones, you'll receive a number of gold
coins equal to the number of stones you
pulled out.<''>

How many stones should you remove to give
yourself the best chance of getting the
most money possible?
!******************************!
Well done!

If you remove 100 stones from the vase,
only one will remain inside. If that
remaining stone is white, it means you've
sucessfully removed 50 stones of each
colour. Of course, removing just two
stones would give you the same chance of
winning the coins as removing 100 stones,
but the amount of money you receive for
sucessfully removing 100 stones dwarfs the
reward you'd receive for two stones.
!******************************!
Too bad!

In situations like this one, it pays to go
for the big money, so don't hold back!

!******************************!
Since the stones are of the same size
and feel, there is absolutely no way to
tell them apart while removing them.
!******************************!
The chances of you winning those coins
are about 50/50.

There's no way of ensuring that you'll
win the coins.
!******************************!
Let's think about this for a moment.

Whether you pull out two stones or 100
stones, your chances of winning the gold
are the same: 50/50.
