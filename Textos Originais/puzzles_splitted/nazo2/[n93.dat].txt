<0094>Puzzling Cubes
<00><28><1E><14><11><36><10><5D><F6><03><04><FF>
Eight cubes have been created based on the
flat plan shown below. These have been
combined to build a larger cube. One of the
eight small cubes has had the letters on
each of its faces erased. The big cube has
been constructed in such a way that all of
the smaller cubes' faces that aren't visible
are pressed against the same-lettered face
of another cube.

Knowing this, can you work out what letter
belongs on the face the arrow is pointing
to? Your answer will be one letter, from
A to F.
!******************************!
That's right!

The correct letter is B.

Whew. That was a tough puzzle, wasn't it?
!******************************!
Too bad!

Don't just take a guess and run with it!
You need to logically work your way towards
the answer. It's that kind of puzzle.

!******************************!
The answer to this puzzle won't simply
pop into your head when you make some
key realisation. You need to work your
way to it.

Three different cubes are touching
three different faces of the cube in
question. Find the letters that must
be on those faces of the unmarked cube.

!******************************!
If the unmarked cube had its faces
restored, all four letters on the right
side of the big cube would be Cs. Note
how all four Cs don't point the same way.
!******************************!
Did you work out which letters are
on the hidden faces of the unmarked
cube?
They are A, D and E.
