<0073>Can Conundrum
<00><1E><1B><18><11><29><02><48><E8><03><04><FF>
A number of identical cans are hanging from
a tree. While all the cans here may look
empty, one is actually filled with water.
See if you can find it.

When deducing your answer, ignore the
weight of each string and stick. 
!******************************!
Nicely done!

The answer is A. The biggest stick connects
to the branch at a point left of the centre
of the stick. Four cans hang from each side
of this big stick, but because the string
holding it to the tree is left of centre,
the set of four cans on the left must be
heavier than the ones on the right.
A, B, C and D all hang from the left side
of the big stick. However, judging by the
number of cans and the positions of the
strings, it's easy to see that A is the
heaviest.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think hard about this puzzle and try again.
!******************************!
Study each can one at a time and
observe how they're balanced, relative
to each other.
!******************************!
Notice how the biggest stick is level
even though it's connected to the tree
at a point left of the stick's centre.

This shows that the water must be in
one of the four cans hanging from the
left side of the big stick.
!******************************!
We know that the water is in one of
the four cans on the left, so finding
the can in question should be a breeze.

Just look at the position of the four
cans on the left relative to the
string attaching all four cans to the
big stick above. Which can looks
heavier than the others?
