Three houses face a single common field.
The heads of these three houses, A, B and
C, decide to work together to seed the
field. Unfortunately, C injures himself
just before work starts, so A and B do all
the work together. To seed the entire field,
A works five days and B works four.

Feeling guilty, C decides to pay A and B
for doing his part of the job. To thank
them, C pays them a total of nine coins,
divided up according to how much work each
person did. Can you work out how many
coins A and B each received?
!******************************!
Smart!

A received six coins and B got three.
You might have been tempted to answer 
five and four coins respectively but,
as shown above, that isn't quite correct.
A and B both had to work three days to
finish their own shares of the work.
Since C wanted to pay A and B for the
work they did for him, he had to base
his payment on the two days of extra work
A did and the one day of work B did.
Therefore, A should receive twice the
pay B did.
!******************************!
Too bad!

When you think about it, the pay you
suggested isn't quite fair.
!******************************!
It's tempting to think that the answer
is to pay each man a coin for each day
he worked, resulting in a total of five
coins for A and four coins for B. But
then that wouldn't be much of a puzzle,
would it?

Remember, the original agreement was
that each man would do an equal share of
the work.
!******************************!
Simply put, A and B are getting paid for
doing the work C was supposed to do.

When considering your answer, don't
factor in the days A and B were
supposed to work according to the
original agreement. C wouldn't be
paying them out of his own pocket for
work they were supposed to do in the
first place.
!******************************!
The coins should be distributed based
on the number of days each person
worked to cover the three days C was
supposed to work.

A did two days, B did one.
