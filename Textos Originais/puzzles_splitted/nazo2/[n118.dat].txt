Use the stylus to move the rubbish to the
bin at the bottom of the screen.


!******************************!
Ah, nice and tidy!

Do your part to keep your town clean!
!******************************!
Too bad!
!******************************!
Feeling like you just can't clear a path,
no matter what you do?

First, take one of the two L-shaped
blocks closest to the bottom and move
things around until you can slip that
block into one of the gaps to the far
left and far right at the top. Choose
the gap that lets you fit the wider
side of your L-shaped block flush
against the wall. 
!******************************!
Continuing from where Hint 1 left off,
your next goal is to move blocks around
so that the blue block in the bin swaps
places with the remaining L-shaped block
in the bottom row.

Make sure you drag the L-shaped block
in question all the way down into the 
bin.
!******************************!
Next, take the L-shaped block you
tucked away in the corner in Hint 1
and bring it back down to its original
position. Now take the two L-shaped
blocks that sat on top at the beginning
of the puzzle and tuck them away in the
gaps located in the top left and right.
Once these two blocks are out of the
way, you can finally drag that hunk of
rubbish out of its hole at the top of
the screen. Now all you've got to do is
get it in the bin!
