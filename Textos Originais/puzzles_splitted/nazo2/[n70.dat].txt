<0071>How Old Is She?
<00><1E><1B><18><12><39><16><46><F6><03><04><3E>
A boy and girl are chatting at a local cafe.
Looking up from his drink, the boy says:

<''>You know, I'm 20, which is twice the
age you were when I was the age you are
now... Isn't that interesting?<''>

As you can see, this boy isn't the most
concise of speakers, but using what he's
said, how old is the girl he's chatting to?
!******************************!
Nice!

A careful read of the puzzle reveals that
when the boy was the girl's current age,
her age was half of the boy's current age.
The boy's current age is 20, and half of
that is 10, so the girl must have been 10
back then.

Once you realise this, it's obvious that
the girl must be 15 at present.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Decide upon a number from which to begin
your reasoning, and take it from there.
!******************************!
Start by working out how old the girl was
back when the boy was her current age.

What relationship does the girl's past
age have with the boy's current age?


!******************************!
Maybe you already picked up on this, but
if you double the girl's age when the
boy was her current age, you get the
boy's current age of 20.

!******************************!
Using the facts in Hint 2, you can
ascertain that the girl was 10 back when
the boy was the girl's current age. 
Since then, X years have passed,
the boy has become 20, and the girl has
become her current age. If you can
find a number of years that, when added
to 10 and subtracted from 20, yield the
same age, you're very close to finding
the girl's current age.

Now what could X be?
