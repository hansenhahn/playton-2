<00><28><24><20><71><51><02><84><E8><03><04><FF>
Two brothers have inherited their parents'
five-piece art collection. According to the
will, the older brother will get a set of
paintings worth twice what the younger
brother gets. In order to ascertain the
value of the paintings, the brothers called
in a valuer, who valued each painting as
shown below. For his services, the valuer
was promised the one painting left over
after the brothers divided the art
according to their parents' wishes.

Assuming that individual paintings can't be
divided, which one does the valuer get?
!******************************!
That's right!

The valuer receives painting E.

The older brother inherits paintings A, C
and D, which are worth <po>120,000 in total.
The younger brother gets a single painting
worth <po>60,000, half of what his brother
gets.

In the end, the valuer takes home the
most expensive painting of all. My, isn't
that convenient!

!******************************!
Too bad!

Maybe you should run through your
calculations one more time.
!******************************!
The valuer is well remunerated for his
work.
!******************************!
None of the paintings the older brother
gets are worth more than any single
painting the younger brother receives.
!******************************!
The older brother inherits three
paintings and the younger brother
inherits one painting.
