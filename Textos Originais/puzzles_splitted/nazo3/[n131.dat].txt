<0131>How to Escape?
<00><28><24><20><11><54><03><83><E9><03><04><FF>
A man sits bound by a long length of rope
among several posts. While he has no hope
of untying his bonds, he can still move
his legs. Were he to stand up and run away,
his long trail of rope looks like it might
catch on at least one of the posts.

He'll need to use his legs to pull up any
posts that the rope will get caught on
before he can dash off. Touch these posts
to mark them with an X.

!******************************!
You did it!

Mark the area encircled by rope and
suddenly this puzzle gets a lot easier.
There's only one post that needs to be
removed for the man to make his getaway.
He'd better hurry up and get that post
loose!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Really study how that rope is looped
around the posts.
!******************************!
Your best bet here is just to look at
how the rope is wrapped around the
posts. Try using the Memo Function to
trace the path the rope takes around
them.
!******************************!
The man only needs to remove a single
post in order to escape.
!******************************!
The two strands of rope coming off the
front of the man's cocoon form a big
loop. Think about which posts are
located inside the loop and which are
outside the loop.

All the posts on the left half of the
picture seem as if they can probably
stay where they are.
