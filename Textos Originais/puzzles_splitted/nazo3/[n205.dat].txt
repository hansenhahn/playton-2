<0135>The Magic Lock
<00><32><2D><28><11><58><1A><CD><00><04><04><FF>
It seems that the lock here is some sort of
magic square. In order to solve it, position
the remaining numbers so that each string
of four vertical, horizontal and diagonal
numbers adds up to the same total.

Solve the magic square to open the hatch!
!******************************!
Very nice!

Each horizontal, vertical and diagonal line
of four tiles adds up to 18 when placed in
the correct positions.

Now, onward to freedom!
!******************************!
Too bad!

At least one string of four numbers isn't
adding up to the same total as all the
others.
!******************************!
You're out to make each horizontal,
vertical and diagonal line of four
numbers equal the same number, so first
you need to find that number.

The total is there for you to find, so
just examine the square until you see it.
!******************************!
One diagonal string of numbers appears
to be in place already. The numbers
within it add up to 18.
!******************************!
Now that you know each string of
numbers needs to add up to 18, all you
need to do is fill in the blank spaces
with the correct tiles. As you start
filling in spaces on the square, you'll
be left with fewer and fewer squares
to work with.

Lay down a line, make sure it totals 18
and then keep on working with what
you've got. You'll make your way to the
solution sooner or later.
