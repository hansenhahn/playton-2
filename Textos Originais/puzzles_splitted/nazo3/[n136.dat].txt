A woman boards a non-stop flight leaving Los
Angeles at 12:00 and arrives in New York at
20:00. The next day, the same woman leaves
New York at 12:00 and flies back to Los
Angeles. The flight is unaffected by jet
streams and takes the same amount of time
to reach its destination as it did the
previous day. The time difference means it
is always three hours later in New York
than in Los Angeles. Can you work out what
time the plane arrives back in Los Angeles?

Good job!

The plane arrives back in Los Angeles at
14:00.

Due to the three-hour time difference,
when it's 12:00 in Los Angeles, it's 15:00
in New York. The plane gets into New York at
20:00, so the duration of the flight must be
five hours. The flight back to Los Angeles
also takes five hours, meaning that it
arrived at 17:00 New York time. Factor in
the time difference to get the plane's
arrival in Los Angeles: 14:00.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Factoring in that bothersome time
difference can be tricky, but as long as
you remember to account for it, you'll
arrive at the correct answer without too
much work.
!******************************!
Think about the rotation of the Earth.
The time in locations farther to the
east is ahead of that of more western
locales.

Therefore, given a three-hour time
difference, when it's 12:00 in
Los Angeles, it must be 15:00 in New York.
!******************************!
Taking into account the time difference,
the plane left Los Angeles at 15:00
New York time and landed at 20:00.
Therefore, the flight itself must have
taken five hours.
!******************************!
The time difference has the reverse
effect on the flight returning to Los
Angeles.

If the plane to Los Angeles left New
York at noon New York time, you could
also say it left New York at 09:00
Los Angeles time.
