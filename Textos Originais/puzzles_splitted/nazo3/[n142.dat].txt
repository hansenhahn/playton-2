<0145>500 Pearls
<00><46><3F><38><12><01><16><8E><F6><03><02><FF>
A wizard sets a traveller a strange task.

<''>There are 500 pearls in that cave. I want
you to go and bring a certain number of
pearls to me. This number allows you to
divide the pearls into groups of 2, 3, 4, 5,
6 or 7 and always have one pearl left over.
Bring me this number of pearls and you can
keep them all for yourself!<''>

The traveller tries his best, but the number
of pearls he brings back doesn't leave one
pearl over when divided into groups of 4.
How many pearls did he bring to the wizard?
!******************************!
Brilliant!
The answer is 211 pearls. The traveller's
number must be between 1 and 500, and
one more than a number that is divisible
by 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7. The quickest way
to find this number is to make a list
of multiples of 7 up to the limit of 500,
then see if those numbers are also divisible
by the other numbers. This takes quite some
time unless you realise that any number
divisible by 6 is also divisible by 2 and 3,
so you really only have to compare your
multiples of 7 against 6 and 5. If only the
traveller had brought back 421 pearls...

Too bad!

This puzzle may seem like a pain to solve,
but if you take the time to calculate
everything, there's really nothing
difficult about it. There are also ways
to reduce the amount of calculation you
need to do.
!******************************!
Let's reduce the wizard's original
question a little. If there is always one
pearl left over when dividing the total
number by the numbers 2 to 7, then the
traveller is being asked to find a number
that can be neatly divided by those
numbers, and then add one to the total.

Don't forget that his answer fails to
take into account the number 4.
!******************************!
The traveller's number must be one more
than a number that can be divided by 2,
3, 5, 6 and 7. This means the number you
want to add one to is a multiple of all
these numbers. Finding it sounds hard,
but there are ways to make it easier.
The largest number, 7, will have the
fewest multiples in the range 1 to 500,
so you should start working out
multiples of 7 in that range and then
see which of those are divisible by the
other numbers.
!******************************!
If you're still finding it too
time-consuming to find common multiples
for the numbers on the list, here's
a little trick.

Any number that is a multiple of 6
is also a multiple of 2 and 3.
