<0141>Disappearing Act 6
<00><63><58><4D><01><01><1D><8A><02><04><02><FF>
Just as before, you can move any ball on
the board below as long as it satisfies
the following conditions:
<->To move, jump your selected ball over an
adjacent space occupied by another ball
into an empty space on the other side.
You can't jump diagonally.
<->Once you've made the jump, the ball you
jumped over disappears from the board.
<->To complete the puzzle, you must remove all
balls from the board except for one.

OK, enough rules. Start getting rid of those
balls!
!******************************!
Masterfully done!
!******************************!
Too bad!
!******************************!
You have quite a few balls to get rid
of, so you'll have to do a lot of jumping.
Just make sure you aren't choosing your
moves at random, or you'll end up getting
stuck before you can finish.

Plan out your jumps so that you never
leave any balls out away from the group
where you won't be able to reach them
later.
!******************************!
As you reduce the number of balls on
the board, those remaining take on a
configuration that you've previously
solved.

If you've made it this far, this puzzle is
in the bag for you.
!******************************!
Sorry, there are no more hints to be had
for this puzzle.

You may have heard that proper
solitaire players don't consider these
puzzles complete unless the remaining
ball ends up in the centre space. One
step at a time, though. Let's finish this
puzzle first.
