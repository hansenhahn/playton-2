<0178>The Ant Takes a Walk
<00><00><00><00><11><01><02><AF><E8><03><02><FF>
A wire cube sits on the floor below, with an
ant sitting at the point under the white
arrow. Starting from its current position,
the ant wants to walk on each wire in the
cube, without ever crossing any length of
wire twice. To do this, you need to add a
single wire to the cube.

To which area out of A, B or C should you
add the wire to make this possible? Note
that the ant may cross over a point where
two or more wires meet as many times as it
likes. Select a letter to answer.

Good job!

The answer is C.

This puzzle uses an ant as a visual aid, but
it's basically asking you to draw a 3D shape
in a single, continuous stroke.

While wire A also lets you draw the cube in
one stroke, it doesn't let you do so when
starting from the white arrow. B is also
incorrect because, no matter where you
start from, you can't complete the drawing
in one continuous line.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Study that wire structure carefully.
!******************************!
Essentially, this puzzle is asking you
where to add a wire in order to create a
3D shape you could draw without ever
lifting your pen from the page or
retracing a line.

Two of the potential answers let you do
this, but only one works when you start
from the point under the white arrow.
