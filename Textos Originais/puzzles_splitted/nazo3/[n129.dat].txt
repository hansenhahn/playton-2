<0129>The Messy Mole
<00><28><24><20><11><3D><05><81><EB><03><04><FF>
On the edge of a forest lives a particularly
messy mole. His burrow is so clogged with
rubbish that he finally has to tidy up.
However, being lazy, he decides to clean his
place while doing the least amount of work
possible.
In order to pick up all the rubbish in his
burrow without passing through any one
tunnel twice, from which of the holes A to G
should the mole start cleaning?
While moving through any tunnel twice is
forbidden, he can pass through any
junction between tunnels as often as he
wants.
!******************************!
Good job!

Our friend the lazy mole should start his
cleaning from hole C. Starting his clean-up
effort from any other hole will cause him to
go through at least one tunnel twice before
the job is finished.
!******************************!
Too bad!

If you start from that hole, the mole has
to go through at least one tunnel two or
more times.

And he really doesn't feel like doing that.
!******************************!
Use the Memo Function to trace
potential courses the mole could follow.
!******************************!
Do you see the three-way junction just
above hole F? That's where the mole will
end up when he's picked up the very last
piece of rubbish. Find a course that lets
him conclude his cleaning at that
location.
!******************************!
Search for a hole that leads to an odd
number of separate routes.
