<0128>Slippery Crossings 3
<00><28><24><20><11><4D><1B><80><01><04><04><FF>
The lake in front of the professor is
frozen solid. The ice is thick enough to
stand on, but so slippery that any movement
in any direction causes him to slide
uncontrollably in that direction until he
hits a wall. While he is stationary, you
can change the professor's direction by
touching the arrows around him.

Can you guide the professor through this
slippery lake to the goal?

!******************************!
Excellent!

Be glad the professor isn't a champion ice
skater. OK, so he'd have an easier time
moving around on the ice, but then you'd be
out of a puzzle because of it.
!******************************!
Too bad!
!******************************!
Take a right at the first wall you bump
into.
!******************************!
The number of walls might make this
puzzle seem daunting, but think of it
this way: the greater the number of
barriers in your path, the more options
you have to work with.

Always think ahead of your current
position on the ice to narrow down the
possibilities.
!******************************!
In order to reach the goal, you must
first stop in a position directly below it.

But considering the complicated nature
of the course, you might have more luck
starting from the goal and working your
way backwards. Do that, and you'll soon
see that you need to position the
professor three spaces below the goal
in order to reach it!
