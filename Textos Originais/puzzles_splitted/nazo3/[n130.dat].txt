<0130>The Strange Painting
<00><1E><1B><18><12><56><05><82><EB><03><04><FF>
The couple in this piece seem to be dancing
high in the air, floating impossibly near the
chandelier. But, when viewed properly,
there's nothing strange at all about the
picture. If you look closely enough, one
peculiar area of the painting hints at the
reason the whole picture seems so odd.

Find that peculiar area and circle it to
learn the truth.
!******************************!
Nice eye!

The couple seem to be the only two people
with a visible reflection on the floor.
It seems that the scene in this painting
isn't of the ball itself, but rather of its
reflection on the ballroom floor!

Perhaps the young couple out on the floor
looked so happy together that the painter
didn't want to ruin their dance by staring
straight at them.
!******************************!
Too bad!

It certainly is hard to see what could
be peculiar about such a happy scene.
!******************************!
Many things about the painting are a
little off, but what one little detail
seems the most unusual to you?
!******************************!
Thoroughly inspect the couple in the
centre of the picture. The answer is
there somewhere.
!******************************!
The couple seems to be dancing in midair,
so naturally you must be curious about
what they're standing on.

Look down at their feet. There's 
something strange going on where
those feet meet the ground...

Do you see it?
