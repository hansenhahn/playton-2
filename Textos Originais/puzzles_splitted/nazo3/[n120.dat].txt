<0120>Tug of War
<00><1E><1B><18><12><40><03><78><E9><03><04><40>
Teams of horses are participating in
tug-of-war matches. All teams are drawn
from an eight-horse stable. The first three
matches end in draws as shown:

Match 1: A B C D vs. E F G H
Match 2: H C B vs. G A
Match 3: D A vs. F H E

If you want the fourth match to result in a
draw as well, which horses should be on the
team pulling against E and F?

Touch a horse to add it to the team.
!******************************!
Well done!

Of course, other match-ups might work, but
the only one you can be sure will end in a
tie based on this information is horse D.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Use the results of the earlier matches
to find the correct team.
!******************************!
There's no need to do any complicated
calculations. The same horses compete
several times, and since a tie means the
teams are equal, think about what might
happen with different matchups.
!******************************!
You can think about the results of the 
first and third matches in the following
way:

A B C D = E F G H
D A = F H E

Subtract the bottom equation from the
top equation and you can come up with
the following:

B C = G
!******************************!
Take the information from Hint 2 and the
results of the second match together
to infer the following:

H C B = G A
B C = G

Subtracting one from the other gives:

H = A

Use this to make a new team.
