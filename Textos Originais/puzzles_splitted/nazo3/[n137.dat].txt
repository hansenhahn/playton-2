<0140>One Extra Block
<00><46><3F><38><11><01><02><89><E8><03><02><FF>
The diagram below shows a structure made
of 28 blocks. Of these blocks, 27 form a
perfect cube, with the remaining block
sitting on top poking out above the rest.

Below this diagram sit those same 28 blocks,
but this time the cube has been separated
into five chunks. Can you work out which
of the chunks, A to E, contains the single
block that sat on top of all the others?

Assume that all five chunks fit together
as shown and can't be rotated from their
current orientation.
!******************************!
Good eye!

B contains the 28th block.

Were you able to visualise all five pieces
reforming the original structure?
!******************************!
Too bad!

Imagine combining all the chunks of the
structure in your head.
!******************************!
If the top block on chunk D were the
block you're searching for, then the
block on the bottom-left corner would
stick out of the cube. D must not be
the correct answer.

Remember, each chunk is locked in its
current orientation and can't be
rotated.
!******************************!
If the block you seek was at the top of
C, then D would be forced out of the
structure when all the chunks were 
put back together.

Chunk C must not be the answer either.
!******************************!
Chunk D forms a part of the front-left
side of the large cube. Use that
information to start reconstructing the
structure in your head.

As the pieces come together, the answer
should become clear.
