<0151>John's Score
<00><63><58><4D><72><01><16><94><F6><03><01><FF>
Four students took a test where every
question had two possible answers, A or B.
Each question was worth 10 points, for a
total of 100 points.

The students' test results were posted as
seen below, but the teacher forgot about
John's score. John was heading to the
teacher's office when Mary called him back,
saying they can determine his score using
the results from the other tests. Can you
work out John's score?
!******************************!
A+!

An A+ for you, that is. Unfortunately for
John, his score was 60 points.

Based on the results from the three scored
tests, you could come up with four possible
answer keys as shown. No matter which one
you use, John's score is 60!
!******************************!
Too bad!

You need to narrow down the conditions.
This puzzle's a tough one.
!******************************!
To solve this puzzle, you'll need to work
out what are the correct answers to
the 10 questions. The easiest way to do
this is to create a chart showing the
potential correct answer for each
question, compare it to the test results
and adjust it so that it matches 
each person's score. Since Mary got
seven questions right, her answers
should be the starting point for your
answer key. Pay attention to where her
answers differ from everyone else's.
!******************************!
Are you finding it hard to find the
correct answers? Using some common
sense can give you a head-start. If all
four students answered a question in
the same way it's quite likely that
it's the correct answer, isn't it?
!******************************!
You'll have noticed that all four people
agreed on an answer for four questions.
They can't all be correct, though, since
Lisa only got 30 points. Let's assume
that three of them are correct, then...
