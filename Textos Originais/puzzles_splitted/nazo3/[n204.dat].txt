The key to the door is sitting behind some
blocks. Slide the key out towards the
professor's hand so that the two can make
their escape!
!******************************!
Great work!

Now Luke and Professor Layton can finally
leave the room!
!******************************!
Too bad!
!******************************!
Before you start moving things around,
focus on what you need to accomplish
first.

Start by finding a way to get the yellow
block at the bottom into the hole
currently occupied by the key.


!******************************!
If you feel like you're stuck, you might
find it easier to just start over.

At the beginning, move the yellow block
into the slot near the professor's hand.
Next, take the square block on the right
and move it to the left. After that, you
need to find some way of moving that
yellow block into the top-right area
of the puzzle.


!******************************!
Once you've completed everything in
Hint 2, you should be able to swap the
key for that yellow block. Once you've
put that yellow block in the slot the key
was in, just shift all the other blocks
and the key in one direction until the
key is positioned at the bottom by
the slot.
