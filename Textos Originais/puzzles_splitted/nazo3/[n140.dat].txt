<0143>Letter Calculations
<00><3C><36><30><12><01><1A><8C><00><04><03><FF>
If you take the problem 11 x 11 = 121 and
replace the 1s with As and the 2s with Bs,
you get AA x AA = ABA.

A similarly-generated letter equation would
be AA x AA = BBCC. Can you work out what A,
B and C equal in the above equation? The
values of A and B may or may not have
changed from the first example.
!******************************!
Sharp thinking!

88 x 88 = 7744

The numbers work out perfectly if you
assign A a value of 8, B a value of 7 and
C a value of 4.

This equation may seem daunting at first,
but if you bear in mind that the
potential values of A are limited,
everything starts coming together

!******************************!
Too bad!

Try running through your calculations
one more time.
!******************************!
Each letter is represented by a single-
digit,  so the possibilities for
each letter represents are fairly
limited.
!******************************!
If you start by replacing A with 1 and
work your way through all the other
possible digits for A, you'll find your
answer before long. What's more, if you
use a calculator, trying out every
possibility will take only a minute or two.

But if you can, try to solve it just
using your head.
!******************************!
Try substituting each digit for A and
working your way up, as detailed in
Hint 2. You'll find the answer in the
last half of your search.
