The following words are written on a famous
mathematician's grave.

<''>Following the 1/6th of my life I spent as a
child, I spent 1/12th of my life as a young
man. Then, 1/7th of my life later, I got
married. Five years after I was wed, I was
blessed with a child, but sadly, he only lived
half the time I was alive before passing
away. Today, four years after his death, I
too will depart from this world.<''>

Can you work out how many years the
mathematician lived?
!******************************!
Very nice!

The mathematician was alive for 84 years.
Setting up a linear equation, as shown
above, makes short work of this puzzle.

Interestingly enough, a puzzle very similar
to the one you just solved is said to be
written upon the headstone of the grave of
Diophantus, a famous ancient Greek
mathematician.
!******************************!
Too bad!

This puzzle takes some brainpower, but
keep at it.
!******************************!
Try setting up a linear equation where
this mathematician's life in years
equals x.
!******************************!
Would you rather not use hard maths to
solve this puzzle? Have no fear, you
can also solve this problem without
using a linear equation.

By adding together 1/6, 1/12, 1/7 and
1/2 of this man's life, you can express
the length of the mathematician's life
as fractions, minus the parts that were
five and four years long. You can find
the answer using only this information.
!******************************!
The lowest common denominator of 1/2,
1/6, 1/7 and 1/12 seems to be the same
as the length of the mathematician's life
expressed in years.
