<0152>The Card Tournament
<00><50><48><40><12><01><16><95><F6><03><01><FF>
Some people meet for a round-robin card
tournament, where every player plays one
hand against every other player. Monty has
to leave after only a few hands, missing the
remainder of the tournament. A total of 59
hands are played at the tournament. How
many hands did Monty play before leaving?

The card game in question is a two-player
game, and no person played with the same
opponent more than once. No one missed any
hands besides Monty.
!******************************!
Good job!
Monty played four hands. First, you need
to find the total number of hands if
everyone stayed. You can find it with an
equation like the one here. If there were 11
people, there would've been 55 hands, and
if there were 12 people, there would've been
66. Since we know 59 hands were played,
there must have been 12 people at the
start. When we subtract the 59 hands
played from the 66 ideal, we learn that
Monty missed seven hands. Since everyone
would've played 11 hands ideally, that means
Monty only played four hands.

Too bad!

This is a calculation problem, but it does
take some ingenuity to solve.
!******************************!
Create an equation with the number of
people and the number of hands played
as variables. That would be a good place
to start.
!******************************!
In order to create the equation for
the number of hands, you would need to
multiply the number of players by the
number of players minus one, then divide
this product by two. If there were three
people, there would have been three
hands. If there were four people, there
would have been six hands. You can
assume from the conditions given that
if no one left, the minimum number of
hands would still have to be at least 60.

There were 12 people at the tournament.
Now think it through!
