Here's a tasty puzzle for you.

Can you move the pile of pancakes from the
blue plate on the left to the red plate on
the right? Wait, though, it's not as easy as
it sounds. You must follow these rules:

<->You can only move one pancake at a time.
<->You cannot place a pancake on top of
another one that is smaller than itself.

You can use the middle plate and move
the pancakes as many times as you like.
!******************************!
Scrumptious!

You gave your stylus quite the workout!
!******************************!
Too bad!
!******************************!
The method for solving pancake puzzles
has been described in many other hints.

Move the smallest pancake over to the
middle plate, then move the next smallest
pancake to the red plate. Next, stack
the smallest pancake on top of the one
on the right. Now take a new, slightly
larger pancake from the stack on the
left and move it onto the open middle
plate. Read more on what to do next in
Hint 2.
!******************************!
From where Hint 1 left off, put the
smallest pancake on the pancake sitting
on the middle plate. Next, move the
pancake on the red plate over to the 
stack on the left. Now bring the smallest
pancake you have over to sit on top of
the stack of pancakes on the left plate.

You can solve this puzzle by repeating
the process outlined in Hints 1 and 2
while introducing bigger and bigger
pancakes, but it's not very efficient.

Aim to limit the number of moves you
make to keep yourself from getting
confused along the way.
