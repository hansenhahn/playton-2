<0001>Dr Schrader's Map
<02><0A><09><08><12><5B><1A><01><00><04><01><FF>
Several pieces have been cut out of the
middle of the map to Dr Schrader's home.
Complete the map by sliding the pieces with
the stylus and inserting them in the right 
places.

It may sound simple, but don't forget that
you can move or remove pieces, including the
one already in the middle of the map.
!******************************!
Excellent work!

Now, let's hurry to the doctor's flat!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Read the puzzle carefully and try again.
!******************************!
Including the one piece that's in the
middle of the map from the start, you
have six pieces to move around but only
five spaces to place them in.

This means one of the pieces is not
actually part of the map.
!******************************!
Take a close look at the missing pieces
and the rest of the map. If you connect
the road patterns at the edges of the
pieces with those at the edges of the
missing spaces, you won't go wrong.
!******************************!
Did you notice that the piece positioned
in the middle of the map at the start of
the puzzle doesn't belong to the map,
and isn't part of the solution?

Now all you have to do is sort out the
other five pieces.
