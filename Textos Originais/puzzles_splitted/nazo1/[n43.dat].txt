<0044>Tangled Ropes
<00><19><13><0D><11><20><16><2B><F6><03><03><FF>
Three loops of rope are tangled together
with a single red rope that has been tied
in a very loose knot. Can you work out
how many of the smaller loops of rope
would get caught in this knot when the
red rope is pulled tight from both ends?

Remember, even if a loop passes through
the knotted part of the red rope now,
it might fall away when the red rope
is tightened.
!******************************!
Good thinking!

Not a single loop will become truly entangled
in the knot that forms. When you pull the
red rope and form a knot, one loop will fall
away and the other two will hang from the
red rope, free of the knot.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Make sure you examine every detail of the
picture carefully!
!******************************!
Look carefully at the places where
different loops overlap the red rope.
Even if they appear to be wrapped
around each other, they may only be
piled on top of each other.

You've probably experienced this
phenomenon before when untangling
a mess of cables at home.

!******************************!
Pay special attention to the big loop
in the red rope, since this is the part
that will form a knot and and is the key
to solving this puzzle.

Try using the Memo Function to trace
which small loops of rope could become
caught in the knot in the red rope when
it is tightened.
!******************************!
Do you see the yellow loop of rope?
It may look tangled in with the others,
but it turns out that when the red rope
is pulled to make a tight knot, this loop
will slip free.

Now, is there anything different about
the other two smaller loops?
