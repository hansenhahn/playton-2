<0054>Painting the Flag
<00><19><16><13><12><19><16><35><F6><03><03><FF>
You have a pristine white flag that you want
to dye into three sections as shown below.
You have three dyes.

No two adjacent sections of the flag can be
the same colour, each section can only be
one colour and you can't change the number
or size of these sections.

If you aren't allowed to mix the dyes, how
many distinct flag designs are possible? 

!******************************!
Sharp thinking!

Once you incorporate the white colour of
the unpainted flag into your designs, you
actually have four colours you can work
with. If you assign a colour to the left
section of the flag and list all designs
possible, you get a total of nine variations.

Multiply this number by four, which
represents the number of colours at your
disposal, to get the answer: 36 variations.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Give the puzzle another try.
!******************************!
You have three dyes you can use on the
flag, but that doesn't mean those are
the only colours at your disposal.
!******************************!
Maybe you've noticed that the white
colour of the flag's fabric is another
colour you can use in making your
designs.
!******************************!
Adding white to the three dyes you have,
there are four colours you can use to
make flag designs.

If the left section of your flag is red,
for example, then combining the other
two dyes and the flag's own white colour
in the remaining two sections gives you a
total of nine distinct designs.
