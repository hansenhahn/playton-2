A man on the train shows you a picture he's
painted.

<''>Let's say this picture has a total area of
10. Can you work out how much of it is made
up of clouds compared to the area that's
made up of sky? Don't think you need to
guess the answer. There's a #rdefinite
method#x you can use to work this out.<''>

How much of the area is sky and how much is
cloud?
!******************************!
Nice job!

The key here is to use the screws on the
frame to divide the picture. Once you do
that, it should be clear that B and F, C
and I, D and G, and E and H are all simply
pairs of the same drawings with the
colours reversed. This means that in these
eight areas there are 4 squares' worth of
cloud and 4 of sky. The remaining two
squares, A and J, are completely blue, so
the totals are 6 squares of sky and 4
squares of cloud.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Take another long, careful look at the
puzzle.
!******************************!
Take a closer look... Not at the picture
itself, but at its frame.

You could use the frame's screws to
simplify how you look at the picture.
!******************************!
Hint 1 pointed out the screws in the
picture frame. Have you noticed that
you can use these as guides to divide
the picture into 10 squares.

Now all you have to do is study the
squares carefully...
!******************************!
Compare each square with the others.
Have you noticed that some squares are
identical in design, but with the
colours swapped? Any such pair of
squares you find have the same amount
of sky and cloud. Also, don't forget
about the two squares that are filled
with just one colour.
