<0058>In the Tunnel
<00><23><1F><1B><12><0D><19><39><FF><03><02><2D>
Two trains pass in the darkness of the long
tunnel. Move them around so that each
locomotive ends up on the opposing track
while keeping its carriages in the same
order. The only carriages that don't need
to end up on the opposing track are the
number 2 carriages of both trains.
!******************************!
That's right!

The two trains speed off into the darkness,
each carrying the number 2 carriage of the
other...
!******************************!
Too bad!

Give the puzzle another try.
!******************************!
To start, try to get all the carriages
going to the top track into their
designated positions before worrying
about the ones headed to the bottom
track.
!******************************!
Move the first red carriage to the side
track that sits between the top and
bottom tracks, then bring down all of
the carriages from the top track.

Now move that red carriage up into
its designated spot on the top track.
!******************************!
You can use the procedure detailed in
Hint 2 to move any carriage from the
bottom track to the top track. Just
move the carriage of your choice into
the side track and move all the
carriages that are blocking your path
to the top track out of the way. Then
it's just a simple matter of bringing
each carriage out of the side track and
up into its designated position.
