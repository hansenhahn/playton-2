<0023>A Sour Defeat

Two men, known here as 1 and 2, are playing
a strange game. First, both men put their
empty pitchers on the table. Next, a judge
brings a pitcher filled with vinegar and
places it in either spot A or spot B.
The judge then starts shifting the vinegar
from one pitcher to any adjacent pitcher
over and over. After moving the liquid 55
times, the owner of the vinegar-filled
pitcher must down it in one! Ugh!

If you were the judge and secretly wanted
2 to drink the vinegar, would you place the
pitcher down in spot A or B?
!******************************!
Nicely done!

The vinegar changes pitchers 55 times,
which is an odd number of pours. Regardless
of where you place your pitcher, whichever
pitcher sits in the middle of the three
will always contain the vinegar after an
odd number of pours.

Therefore, in order for man 2 to drink, the
vinegar-filled pitcher must go in spot B,
because doing so will put man 2's pitcher in
the middle, thus guaranteeing the vinegar
ends up in his pitcher.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Normally, you might need some encouragement
to try again at this point, but as there are
only two possible answers to this problem,
you now know the solution...

Do try to work out the reasoning behind the
solution before answering, though!
!******************************!
Grab a few water glasses and try the
puzzle out for yourself, minus the
vinegar, of course.

The rule that determines where the
vinegar ends up should soon become
obvious.
!******************************!
If you stopped after five pours instead
of 55, would anything be different?
!******************************!
Isn't it funny how on every
odd-numbered pour, the vinegar ends up
in the middle of the three pitchers?
