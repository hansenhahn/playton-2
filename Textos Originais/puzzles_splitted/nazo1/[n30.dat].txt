<0031>Pass the Apples
<00><14><12><10><11><1E><1C><1E><F6><03><03><FF>
Johnny and Thomas are each carrying some
apples. If Johnny gave Thomas one apple, the
two men would each have the same number of
apples. Conversely, if Thomas gave Johnny
two apples, Johnny would have three times
the number of apples that Thomas has.

So, just how many apples are each of the
men holding?
!******************************!
Nice!

Johnny has seven apples and Thomas has
five.

As you can tell, if Johnny gave Thomas one
apple, both men would have six apples.
Additionally, if Thomas decided to give
Johnny two of his apples, Johnny would have
nine apples in total, three times as many
as Thomas.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think hard about the puzzle and try again.
!******************************!
<''>If Johnny gave Thomas one apple, the
two men would each have the same number
of apples.<''>

A little critical thinking applied to the
above statement tells you that Johnny
must have two more apples than Thomas.
!******************************!
<''>If Thomas gave Johnny two apples,
Johnny would have three times the
number of apples that Thomas would
have.<''>

You know from Hint 1 that the gap
between Johnny and Thomas is two. In
the above scenario, the gap increases
by four, to six. We now know that
when Thomas loses two apples, Johnny
has six more than him, and also three
times more.
!******************************!
Can you think of a number where the
result of adding six and multiplying by
three is the same? That number is how
many apples Thomas has after giving two
away. So if we add those two back,
Thomas has...
