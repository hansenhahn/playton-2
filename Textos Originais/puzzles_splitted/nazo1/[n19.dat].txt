<0020>The Shoe Shop Thief
<01><19><16><13><11><0A><16><13><F6><03><02><FF>
A woman in a shoe shop pays for a <po>30 pair
of shoes with a <po>50 note. The salesman
doesn't have enough change, so he goes to
the shop next door to break the <po>50 note,
returns to his shop and gives the woman her
change. A while later, the shopkeeper from
next door storms into the shoe shop.
It turns out that the note he gave her was
a fake! The mortified shoe salesman gives
the shopkeeper <po>50 from the till to
apologise. Neither the customer nor the
shoes she took are found.

In total, how much did the shoe shop lose?
!******************************!
Well done!

The shoes the customer made off with
cost <po>30, and the change the salesman
gave her cost him another <po>20, bringing
his total losses to <po>50.

The salesman received <po>50 of real money
in exchange for the fake note from the
shopkeeper next door, and then gave her
<po>50 back when she discovered the note he
gave her was fake. These last two
transactions cancel each other out.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think hard about the puzzle and try again.
!******************************!
Had the shoe salesman not gone next
door to get change, he might never have
realised he lost money.

How much would he have lost if he had
the change in the till?
!******************************!
Since he used a fake note, the change
the salesman got from next door was
essentially <''>money for nothing<''>.
He gained <po>50.

In returning the money, he later lost
<po>50.
!******************************!
The sneaky customer ended up getting
away with shoes costing <po>30, as well as
<po>20 in change.
