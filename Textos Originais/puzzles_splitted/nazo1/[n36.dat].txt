<0037>World's Best Golfer

A  pro golfer has the amazing ability to
consistently putt distances of 3, 5, 7 and
11 metres. Strangely enough, though, those
are the only distances he can putt.

Currently, our golfer stands on the green
with his ball 20 metres from the hole.
What's the fewest number of strokes he can
use to get the ball into the hole?

Assume that if the ball is hit farther than
the distance remaining to the hole, it will
roll over to the other side without going
into the cup. 
!******************************!
Good job!

If our friend the pro golfer putts two
diagonal shots as shown above, he can
sink the ball in two shots. No one ever
said the golfer had to putt directly
towards the hole, did they?

Sure, in order to sink the putt using
the method shown above, he'd need to
calculate the angle of each shot
perfectly, but that's probably why they
call him a pro!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Remember, this is a pro golfer we're talking
about. He can do some pretty amazing things.
!******************************!
The correct solution doesn't involve the
golfer overshooting the hole.
!******************************!
There's no reason our golfing friend
should have to hit each putt straight
towards the hole.

Perhaps he could put his ball in a better
position with a shot that travels
diagonally.
!******************************!
Picture the golfer taking a diagonal
shot relative to the hole. If he hits the
ball exactly 11 metres and angles the
shot so that this first putt puts him
exactly halfway between his starting
position and the hole...

Do you see where this is going?
