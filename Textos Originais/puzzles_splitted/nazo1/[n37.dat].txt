<0038>Four Horses
<00><23><1F><1B><32><20><16><25><F6><03><03><08>
You have four horses, all of which travel at
different speeds. In travelling from point A
to point B, these horses take one, two, four
and six hours respectively.

One day, you decide to move all your horses
from point A to point B. However, you can
only move a maximum of two horses at a time,
and you need to ride a horse back to
point A each time you return to move your
other horses. Knowing you can only move as
fast as the slowest horse you're travelling
with, what's the fewest number of hours it
will take to move all the horses?
!******************************!
That's right!

To start, take your one- and two-hour
horses. Then ride your one-hour horse
back. Next, ride out on your four- and
six-hour horses, and return on your
two-hour horse. At this point you've been
moving horses for 11 hours - three in the
first excursion, and eight in the next.

Now you should be back at point A with your
one- and two-hour horses. Ride them both
across to point B to finish the task in 
13 hours.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think hard about what the puzzle is asking
you to do.
!******************************!
When crossing back over from B to A, you
want to move as quickly as possible, so
make sure you put yourself in a position
to cross over to A on the one-hour
horse when possible.

However, if you always make travelling
back on your one-hour horse your top
priority, you may end up wasting time on
other legs of the journey. Don't assume
you always need to return from B to A
on the one-hour horse.
!******************************!
In order to move all your horses from
A to B in the shortest amount of time,
you'll need to cross over from A to B
three times and return from B to A
twice.

How do you make the most effective use
of this limited number of crossings?
!******************************!
First, bring your one-hour and two-hour
horses over to B, then return to A on
your one-hour horse.

Next, bring your four- and six-hour
horses over to B and return to A on
your two-hour horse.

This method minimises the overall amount
of time necessary to move all your
horses to point B.
