<0052>Hat Weather
<00><1E><1B><18><71><18><0B><33><F1><03><03><FF>
There is a fellow with very particular rules
about when he wears his hat.
<->When it's sunny, he always wears his hat.
<->When it's rainy, he doesn't wear his hat.
<->When it's cloudy, he doesn't wear his
hat unless it's been cloudy for two days in
a row, in which case he wears his hat on the
second of these days.

Below is a schedule of when this fellow
decided to wear his hat over the course of
one week. Use the panels to fill in the
weather for each day of the week.
!******************************!
Excellent!

If you assume that the Monday shown was
the second cloudy day in a row, then our
friend must have worn his hat on that day.
The rest of the solution then falls right
into place.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think hard about the man's rules concerning
his hat and try again.
!******************************!
Start by placing a rain tile on each
day where our friend didn't wear a hat.
!******************************!
Once you place the rain tiles down as
described in Hint 1, you may notice that
there are no more places left for your
cloud tile.

You could place it down on one of the
days with a hat if that day was the
second day of cloudy weather in a row,
but no two days in this week appear to
have been cloudy...
!******************************!
If the weather was cloudy on the Sunday
of the previous week, he could wear his
hat on Monday.
