<0009>Stacked Glasses
<00><0A><08><06><12><0B><02><08><E8><03><02><FF>
The owner of a four-star restaurant
assigns a young waiter the task of stacking
glasses in a decorative way. Eager to
please, the waiter immediately draws five
separate designs and shows them to the
owner. The owner takes one glance at the
designs and, with a look of irritation, turns
to the boy and cries, <''>This design is
preposterous! What were you thinking?<''>.

Which of the five designs is the owner
talking about?
!******************************!
Exactly right!

The restaurant owner was talking about
sketch D. If you look closely, you can see
that the first and second row of glasses
couldn't possibly be arranged in the
manner depicted.

The simple 2D sketch didn't take into
account the rim of the glass.

!******************************!
Too bad!

Why do you suppose a simple drawing made
the restaurant owner so angry?
!******************************!
<''>This design is preposterous!<''>

The owner wasn't angry because the
design in question was hard to assemble.
He was upset because the design was
physically impossible to replicate in
real life.




!******************************!
A and C could probably be achieved with
steady hands and a lot of patience.

That leaves B, D and E.
!******************************!
There is one design that can be drawn
in 2D but, in reality, stacks the
glasses in an impossible way.

On paper, each cup is represented by a
single U-shaped line, but real glasses
have more to them than that, namely
sides and a rim on top.
