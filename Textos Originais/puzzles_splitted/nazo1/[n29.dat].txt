<0030>The Wrong Date
<00><1E><1B><18><11><1C><23><1D><F6><03><03><FF>
Dropstone was founded 50 years ago, and
the founders commissioned a stone
sculpture to commemorate that day.
Unfortunately the dozy sculptor managed to
engrave the wrong date onto it. The whole
village had to live with the erroneous
sculpture until some bright spark realised
that converting it in a certain way would
enable the correct date to be displayed.
Think about what the sculpture could have
been converted into in order to display the
correct date.
On which date was Dropstone founded?
Answer in four digits (DD/MM).
!******************************!
Brilliant!

When converted into a fountain, water fills
the bowl, allowing the true date of
Dropstone's founding, 13-8, to be displayed.

The inattentive sculptor must have been
relieved at getting away with such sloppy
chiselling.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think hard about the puzzle and try again.
!******************************!
The puzzle text tells you that the
sculptor engraved the wrong date into
the stone, so you know that 12-8 isn't
the date Dropstone was founded.
!******************************!
Does the sculpture's shape give you a
clue into what it could have been
converted?

That big bowl and the opening at the
top should indicate that this sculpture
is now a fountain.
!******************************!
Though currently dry, the fountain's
big bowl is usually filled with water.

Why don't you take a moment to...reflect
on this?
