<0060>Plaza Puzzle
<00><19><16><13><11><23><06><3B><EC><03><04><FF>
<''>So there's a big old statue in the middle
of this plaza. When you take away the area
occupied by the statue, the plaza looks
sort of doughnut-like in shape. What you
have to do is divide this doughnut-like
plaza into two identically shaped parts
using only one line.

Oh, and before you get any big ideas, the
dotted lines shown below won't cut it 'cause
they're actually two lines.<''>

Draw your answer on the Touch Screen.
!******************************!
Nice!

If you draw a circle around the plaza about
one third of the way out from the middle,
your line will divide the doughnut shape
into two identically-shaped figures that are
directly proportional. In geometrical
terms, shapes like these are known as
similar figures.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Focus on the term <''>one line<''>.
There's a hint somewhere in there.
!******************************!
In the example illustration, the plaza has
been divided by two lines, which makes
the answer invalid.

The fact that you need to use a single
line to solve the puzzle is key. Since you
can only use one line, you know you won't
be solving this one by drawing lines
through the middle of the plaza.
!******************************!
Even if you avoid drawing your line
through the middle of the plaza, no
single straight line will divide the plaza
into two pieces that are the same shape.

By the way, did you notice that the goal
here isn't to make two pieces that are
the same size?
!******************************!
If you're still having trouble, you
should know that the single line you
need to draw is a circle.

The only remaining question is where to
draw it so that the two pieces of the
plaza have the same shape and are
directly proportional to one another.
