<0059>A Ticket to Where?
<00><28><24><20><11><0D><16><3A><F6><03><02><FF>
In front of you is the ticket that Layton
and Luke found in Dr Schrader's flat.
At first glance, the ticket appears to have
no destination written on it. But when you
look at it in just the right way, the ticket
discloses its destination: the town of
Folsense. The key to spotting the
destination is the #rnumber#x that has been
cut out of the ticket. Can you work out
which number must have been there?

Use the ticket in the instruction booklet to
puzzle this one out!
!******************************!
Excellent!

The missing number is 2.

If you fold the ticket as shown and line up
the two sets of numbers, they form letters
that spell out the word <''>FOLSENSE<''>.
It looks like the ticket's destination was
there all along!
!******************************!
Too bad!

To solve this puzzle you'll need to do
something to the ticket that allows you to
connect the two rows of numbers in some
fashion.
!******************************!
To find the answer, you have to fold the
ticket in a particular way.
!******************************!
Hold the ticket lengthwise and fold it
inwards along the middle. Next, fold each
side outwards, halfway along each row of
numbers.

The top half of the top row of numbers
and the bottom half of the bottom row 
of numbers will connect to each other,
revealing a string of letters.
!******************************!
The word <''>FOLSENSE<''> is written on this
ticket.

Which number must belong in the cut-out
portion in order to form an E when the
ticket is folded?
