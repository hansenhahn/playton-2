<0039>A Change of Clothes
<00><1E><1B><18><11><1D><0A><26><4E><04><03><FF>
A, B and C each started off with shirts and
trousers of the same colour. A wore red,
B wore blue, and C wore white. They were
then blindfolded and swapped items of
clothing. After they took their blindfolds
off, here's what they said: 

A: No one's shirts and trousers match!
B: It looks like C's the only one of us who
didn't keep any of his original clothes.
C: I don't know if like these red trousers.

Touch the people to change their clothing
and assemble their current outfits.
!******************************!
Nicely done!

You know that C is the only one not wearing
something from his original outfit, meaning
he's not wearing anything white. You also
know he has red trousers, so his shirt must
be blue.

Since A and B are each wearing one item of
their own, you can deduce that A is dressed
in a red shirt and B in blue trousers. With
all that settled, all you have to do is place
your remaining white items in the right
places and the puzzle is solved.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Give it another try and see what develops.
!******************************!
You know that C's wearing red trousers
and isn't wearing any of the white
clothes he previously wore, so his shirt
has to be blue.
!******************************!
Bear in mind that C's the only one of the
three men not wearing any of the items
he originally wore.
!******************************!
A and B must both be wearing a single
piece of clothing, shirt or trousers,
that they wore previously.
