Now for something on the flowery side.

Of the three pictures labelled A, B and C,
one is actually the same as the picture on
the far left. However, the image on the far
left has had its contents flipped left to
right and its colours inverted and changed
to black and white.

Of A, B and C, which picture is the same as
the black-and-white picture on the far left?
!******************************!
That's right!

Picture A is the same as the one on the
far left.

As shown above, pictures B and C have
slight variations.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think hard about the puzzle and try again.
!******************************!
The inverted colours of the altered
image makes this puzzle a lot more
challenging, doesn't it?

However, this change to the image may
end up helping you more than you think. 
Remember, in the altered image, dark
spots are now bright and vice versa.

!******************************!
Searching for differences between the
black-and-white image and each of the
three pictures A, B and C will
eventually lead you to the answer,
but there is an easier way.

Since one of the three is the same as
the black-and-white picture anyway,
why not start by finding how A, B and
C differ from one another?
!******************************!
Pay attention to the circles at the
centre of each flower. Also, take a good
look at the number of dots in each image
and their positions.
