<0007>Four Couples
<00><14><12><10><11><0B><05><06><EB><03><02><FF>
Four couples sit in a crowded dining car.
All diners are sitting next to or across
from their partners:

<->The Joneses are sitting by the aisle.
<->The moustachioed Mr O'Connor is sitting
next to his wife.
<->Mr Lambert is sitting opposite his wife.

Using the information above, can you
determine where Mrs Hadley is sitting?
Circle her and touch #rSubmit#x.
!******************************!
That's right!

Moustachioed Mr O'Connor is sitting next to
his wife, so all the people on the left must
be sitting next to their spouses.
Mr Lambert is sitting opposite his wife, so
he must be sitting at the right-hand table.

The Joneses are sitting by the aisle, so
they must be c and g. That leaves e and
f as the Hadleys.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think hard about the clues you've been
given and try again.
!******************************!
The moustachioed Mr O'Connor is b.
Since both c and f are men, his wife has
to be a. 
!******************************!
The Joneses are both sitting by the
aisle, which means they must be sitting
opposite each other.

Since you know b is Mr O'Connor, c and g
must be Mr and Mrs Jones.
!******************************!
Where is Mr Lambert in all this?

We now know a and b to be the O'Connors,
so the people sitting opposite them must
also be a couple. But they can't be the
Lamberts because the Lamberts have to
be sitting opposite each other.

You should now be able to identify all
four couples.
