The drawing below is made up of curved lines
that intersect to create sections. If you
want to colour in the entire canvas so that
no section touches a section of the same
colour, what's the fewest number of colours
you can use?
You can use a colour as many times as you
like as long as it doesn't touch a section
with the same colour.

Once you have your answer, touch
#rInput Answer#x and enter the number of
colours. 

!******************************!
That's right!

You'll need three colours to fill in the
drawing. Most of the drawing can be done
with two colours, but one pesky area in
the bottom-left corner requires a third
colour to complete.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think about it and have another shot.
!******************************!
There's no trick here.

You might have an easier time if you
use the Memo Function to mark sections
of the drawing.
!******************************!
Why don't you take a closer look at
the corners of the drawing?
!******************************!
You can complete most of the drawing
using only two colours, but did you
notice there's one pesky area down in
the bottom-left corner that requires
an additional colour?
