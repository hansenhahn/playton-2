<0017>The Ant's Journey
<00><19><16><13><12><08><09><10><EF><03><02><FF>
Busy ants work tirelessly carrying food
back to their nest. One such ant was
returning with food when she bumped into an
acquaintance in front of the nest.

<''>What are you playing at? Didn't you notice
that you took the #rlongest path possible
back to the nest#x? Think about where you're
going next time!<''>

Knowing that the ant never travelled on the
same path twice, can you trace the route
the returning ant walked to get to her
nest?
!******************************!
That's right!

Perhaps all the heavy lifting kept this little
ant from thinking about her path home. If
only she'd thought about where she was
going, she could have saved herself a lot of
walking!
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think hard about the puzzle and try again.
!******************************!
When tracing out a route back to the
nest, leave as few paths untouched as
possible.
!******************************!
Assuming the top of the screen to be
north, go south from the start point
and then go west at the first
opportunity.

At the next junction, head north to the
top of the map.   

When you reach a T-junction at the top
of the map, head west again. When you
then hit a wall, take the path leading
south.
!******************************!
From the point you ended up at after
following the directions in Hint 2, head
east at the first available point, and
then take the next path that heads
south.

Once you get that far, the rest of the
route should be a breeze.
