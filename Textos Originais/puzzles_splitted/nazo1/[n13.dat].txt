A teacher had everyone in her class close
their eyes. While none of the students were
looking, she slipped caps onto their heads,
and said:

<''>OK, everyone, open your eyes and look at
your friends' caps. Whoever sees four or
more people wearing red caps gets a red
balloon, and whoever doesn't gets a blue
balloon.<''>

In a class of 10 children, only some got a
red balloon. But how many?
!******************************!
That's right!

You know that only some children got red
balloons. If five or more children were
wearing a red cap, every child in the class
would see at least four red caps and get a
red balloon, so it must be fewer than five.
But if three or fewer children were wearing
red caps, no one would see four red caps.

Therefore, four children must have had red
caps, meaning that the other six children
received red balloons.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think hard about the puzzle and try again.
!******************************!
The puzzle says that some of the
children received red balloons. This
means some children saw four or more
red caps.

If there were, say, three children
wearing red caps, then no one would
get a red balloon.

So there must be four or more children
wearing red caps.
 
!******************************!
The puzzle says that #rsome#x of the
children received a red balloon.

By definition, therefore, not all
the children received a red balloon.
What would be the number of red hats
that would allow everyone to receive
a red balloon?

The answer is less than that number.
!******************************!
If all 10 children were wearing red caps,
then everyone would see at least four
and would get a red balloon. But no
child can see the cap on their own head.
With this in mind, ask yourself how many
children would receive a red balloon if
nine of them wore red hats. What about
if eight did? Seven?

Just keep going down the line, and
remember that at least four must be
wearing red caps.
