<0055>Sammy's Necklace
<00><1E><1B><18><11><15><16><36><F6><03><03><FF>
Sammy has eight chains with seven links
each. He wants to connect all these chains
to make a necklace. The jeweller says that
it will cost <po>2 each time he opens and closes
a single link.

As shown below, Sammy could open one end of
each of the eight chains to make one long
necklace. However, that would cost <po>16, and
the truth is that there's a cheaper way to
get the same result. Using the cheapest
method possible, how much will it cost to
make the necklace?
!******************************!
Score!

Take one of Sammy's seven-link chains,
break each link apart, and use them to
connect the remaining small chains together,
as shown in the illustration.

If Sammy uses this method, he can get the
necklace of his dreams for only <po>14.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Give the puzzle another try.
!******************************!
The number of links in each small chain
is a crucial clue that will help you
solve the puzzle.
!******************************!
You haven't only been opening the
links on the ends of each small chain,
have you?
!******************************!
Try taking one small chain, popping
open each of its seven links, and using
those individual open links to connect
the other small chains together.

Is the answer clearer now?
