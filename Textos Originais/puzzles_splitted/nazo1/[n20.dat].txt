Eight people are playing a communication
game. In this game, one player has to get
their message across to seven other
people.

It takes one minute to pass along the
message, and each time the message is
spoken, it can only have one recipient.
Using these rules, what's the shortest
amount of time required for the message to
pass to all seven other players?
!******************************!
Very nice!

If the original messenger spreads the word
as shown above, the game can be completed
in three minutes. During that time, the
original messenger can tell three people the
message, and the people who hear the
message within the first two minutes can go
on to become messengers themselves.

When an emergency arises, information
networks structured in the above fashion
can help get the word out fast.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Are you sure you're not being led astray by
the wording of the puzzle?
!******************************!
<''>Each time the message is spoken, it
can only have one recipient.<''>

What you need to remember here is that
any one person can only spread the
message to one other person at a time.

Try reading the puzzle again while
bearing the above in mind.

!******************************!
Every time a given person relays the
message to another person, the number
of people who know the message will
increase by one. 
!******************************!
One minute after the game starts,
two people will know the message.

If each of those people then goes on to
spread the message, by the end of the
second minute, a total of four people
will know the message.

Can you see where this is going?
