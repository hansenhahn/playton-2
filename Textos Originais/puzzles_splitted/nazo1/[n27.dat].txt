<0028>The Warped Wheel
<00><14><12><10><12><1A><02><1B><E8><03><03><FF>
In the back of the train yard, there's an
old, warped wheel lying on the ground, as
shown below. While no longer functional, the
wheel is interesting because, when rolled on
a flat surface, its axle traces a funny
pattern if you look at it from the side.

Of the five diagrams below, which one
depicts the actual path of the axle?
!******************************!
That's right!

Diagram A correctly traces the path of the
axle as the wheel rolls.

You probably won't see this wheel on a train
anytime soon, but it would be fun to watch
it bounce around.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Try imagining how the wheel rotates again.

!******************************!
This wheel's shape is essentially a
triangle with the corners rounded off.
Since the axle is positioned close to
one of the corners, you can expect the
pattern it creates to be rather
unconventional.
!******************************!
The axle is positioned far from the
centre of the wheel, so you can expect
the path it traces to contain an
exaggerated up-and-down movement.
!******************************!
The answer isn't B or E. Choose from
the remaining three options and don't
forget what you read in Hint 2!
