<0047>The Mayoral Election
<00><19><16><13><12><1C><16><2E><F6><03><03><FF>
Three people at odds with one another are
running for mayor in the upcoming town
election. They are all locals of the town,
which has a voter population of 40.
In order to win, a candidate must get
more votes than any other candidate.

If each of the 40 voters casts a single
vote and every vote is recognised, what
is the fewest number of votes a candidate
needs to secure victory?
!******************************!
That's right!

The winner needs at least 20 votes.

Since each of the candidates dislikes the
other two, they will probably all vote for
themselves. 40 votes minus those three
votes leaves 37 votes. The winner will need
over half the votes, or 19. Add the winning
candidate's personal vote to that and you
get 20 votes. Even if another candidate
gathered all the remaining 18 votes, that
wouldn't be enough to overcome the
candidate with 20 votes. 
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think hard about the clues you've been
given and try again.
!******************************!
Think about how many votes will be cast
in the town excluding the three cast by
the candidates themselves.
!******************************!
The three candidates themselves also
have the right to vote.

Of course, since each of them wants to
win, you can take it for granted that
each candidate will vote for themselves.
!******************************!
40 votes minus the three votes cast
by the candidates leaves you with 37
votes.

Find the number of votes it takes to
gain a majority in a pool of 37 voters
and add one additional vote to that sum
to get your answer.
