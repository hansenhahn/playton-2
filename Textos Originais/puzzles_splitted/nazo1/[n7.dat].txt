<0008>Luke's Big Dinner

<''>Luke, are you sure you can really eat all
that? You put in quite an order there.<''>

<''>No problem, Professor! I'll clean my plate
and still have room for more.<''>

It's no wonder the professor is concerned,
as Luke's order cost twice what his own did!

Below you can see all the items the two
ordered, along with their prices.

Touch the prices of the items that Luke
ordered.
!******************************!
Good work!

If you calculate the total bill, you'll see
that the meal cost <po>105. Knowing the total,
Luke must have ordered <po>70 worth of food
and the professor <po>35 worth. Once you've
got those numbers, the rest is easy.

<''>Are you sure you didn't order too much?<''>

<''>Nope! This (slurp) stew's great and the
steak is (chomp) delicious too!<''>

<''>...<''>
!******************************!
Too bad!

Perhaps you aren't going about this quite
the right way. Why don't you try a
different approach?
!******************************!
Start by adding up the cost of all the
items on the table.
!******************************!
Luke's meal cost twice as much as the
professor's. That means the ratio of
Luke's part of the bill compared to
the professor's must be 2:1.
!******************************!
The cost of the entire meal comes to
<po>105. This total needs to be split to fit
our ratio of 2:1. The sum of the parts of
this ratio is 3, so divide the total by 3
to get <po>35 and the costs come to
(2 x <po>35):(1 x <po>35). Therefore, Luke's
meal cost <po>70 and the professor's <po>35.

What combination of food and drink items
can you find that adds up to <po>70?
