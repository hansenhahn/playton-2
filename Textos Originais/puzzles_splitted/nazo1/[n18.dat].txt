<0019>The Train Journey
<01><14><12><10><12><09><16><12><F6><03><02><FF>
A number of people are on a train. At the
first station the train pulls into, 1/6 of
the people on board get off. At the next
station, 1/5 of the remaining passengers
get off. This pattern continues so that at
the next station 1/4 get off, then 1/3 and
then 1/2. Then, at the final station, all
remaining passengers get off the train.

Assuming no one got on the train during the
journey, what is the lowest number of
people who could have been on the train
when it set out?
!******************************!
Good work!

If you assume the train started out with
six passengers, then only one person
would have to get off at each station.

This puzzle can be really tough if you
don't remember to reduce the number of
people remaining on the train at each
station along the way.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think hard about the information you've
been given and try again. This puzzle comes
together quite easily once you realise a
certain simple principle.
!******************************!
Since the puzzle tells you that no one
got on the train during the journey,
it's safe to say that the number of
passengers on the train never
increased.
!******************************!
Since 1/6 of the passengers get off at
the first station, you know the number
must be divisible by six. Start by
choosing a number that's divisible by
six and see what happens.

The principle by which this puzzle
is solved should soon become evident.
!******************************!
Imagine that 30 passengers are on the
train when it departs. At the first
station, the train loses 1/6 of its
passengers, meaning five people get off.
At the next station, 1/5 of the
remaining 25, or five people, get off.
At the next station, 1/4 of the
remaining 20, which is to say five more
people, get off.

Do you notice a pattern here?
