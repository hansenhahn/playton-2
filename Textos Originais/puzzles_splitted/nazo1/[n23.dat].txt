<0024>A Strip of Paper
<01><0A><09><08><11><09><16><17><F6><03><02><FF>
After trying to fold a strip of paper in
half, you notice that one side of the
folded strip is one centimetre longer than
the other. Determined to get it right, you
fold the strip again, only to discover that
now the other end of the folded strip is
one centimetre longer than the other.

You've now made two fold creases in the
strip. What is the distance in millimetres
between the two creases?
!******************************!
That's right!

The distance between the creases is one
centimetre, or 10 millimetres.

If you're having trouble visualising this,
imagine that the matchbox shown above has
a height of one centimetre.

Now imagine that one of the matchbox's
sides was removed. It looks just like
your strip of paper after being folded
twice! The excess length of your folds
is represented by the remaining side.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Start by considering where the first fold
along the paper strip must be positioned.
!******************************!
Think about how much longer one <''>half<''> of
the strip was compared to the other one
after the first fold.
!******************************!
Remember, you're being asked to answer
in millimetres.
!******************************!
Consider the location of the first fold.
The second fold must have been
positioned one centimetre away from
this location.

Does that clear things up for you?
