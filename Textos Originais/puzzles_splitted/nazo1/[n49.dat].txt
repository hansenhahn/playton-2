Five cows are grazing at the festival. Two
of them are Troomoo cows, a breed that only
tells the truth. The other three are Nowhey
cows, a different variety that always lies.
Use the following statements from each cow
to work out which cows are liars.
Touch a letter to mark it with an X.

A: D is a Nowhey. I promise.
B: Oh no, C isn't a Troomoo cow.
C: A ain't a Nowhey cow. No way.
D: E's a Nowhey if I've ever seen one.
E: B's definitely not a Troomoo.
!******************************!
That's right!

Cows A, C and E are Nowheys. If you assume
each cow to be a Nowhey or a Troomoo and
run through each of the cows' statements,
you'll eventually realise that the only time
there can be three Nowheys is if they are
A, C and E.
!******************************!
Too bad!

Think hard about what the cows said and try
again.
!******************************!
Don't overthink this one. Imagine a
variety of possibilities and try each
one out.
!******************************!
Assign a breed to a cow and then run
through all the cows' statements to
see if they are consistent. You
should come across the solution soon.

!******************************!
Let's assume for a moment that cow A
is a Troomoo. If you assume this to be
true and go through the statements
for each cow, you should come to the
conclusion that you must have three
Troomoo cows and two Nowheys. Since
you know that there are two Troomoos
and three Nowheys, you know that this
assumption must be incorrect.
