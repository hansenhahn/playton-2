<0025>Surviving in the Wild
<00><14><12><10><11><12><03><18><E9><03><02><FF>
After years of bad business, a zoo has
finally run out of money to buy food for
its animals. Bellies rumbling from days with
no food, the animals make a plan to escape
the zoo. After prising open the rusty bars
on their cages, all the animals attempt to
find their way through the maze-like paths
of the zoo to the exit.

Touch the picture of each animal you think
made it safely out of the zoo and then
touch #rSubmit#x to answer. Just remember,
animals show their true colours in the wild.
!******************************!
Sharp thinking!

The only animal that will safely escape to
freedom is the lion. While both the rabbit
and the lion will make it as far as the path
to the exit, the second the lion spots the
rabbit he's guaranteed to eat it.

Nature, red in tooth and claw...

!******************************!
Too bad!

Think hard about the puzzle and try again.
!******************************!
To start, try tracing your way through
the maze with the stylus.

Also, this trick is probably old news
to you by now, but in case you've
forgotten, it's often helpful to try
working your way backwards from the
exit.
!******************************!
Do mazes make your head spin? Take some
of the work out of following all those
corridors by using the Memo Function to
mark dead ends and the paths that lead
to them.
!******************************!
If you've already worked out which
animals can make it to the exit,
congratulations! But think for a
moment about the title of this puzzle.
All the animals are free once they
leave their cage, but it can be a jungle
out there. Just because there is a
route from an animal's cage to the exit,
doesn't necessarily mean that animal
will be able to make it there safely.
